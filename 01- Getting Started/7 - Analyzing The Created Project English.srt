1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:05,740
So we created this project, this expert project
2

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,250
before we run it now,
3

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:09,260
I wanna open the created project
4

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,160
in an editor that allows me to edit the code
5

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,740
in a convenient way.
6

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,460
Now you can use any code editor you want,
7

7
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:19,290
My recommendation is Visuals Studio Code,
8

8
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:21,970
which is an amazing free code editor,
9

9
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:25,290
That's very extensible and fun to use.
10

10
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:28,000
You can download it for all platforms.
11

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,360
And I already do have installed it for Mac OS.
12

12
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,700
Now with vscode installed,
13

13
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,590
you can open it and you might see a welcome screen.
14

14
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:39,150
If you installed it for the first time,
15

15
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,000
you can simply close that screen.
16

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,800
And then you should see something like this,
17

17
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,300
where you can open a new folder.
18

18
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,070
Alternatively, you can always go to the menu file
19

19
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:50,280
and find open on Windows,
20

20
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,320
or open folder on Mac OS still.
21

21
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,120
And then if you click that,
22

22
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,100
it will open such a file picker,
23

23
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,640
where you can now select that project
24

24
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,060
folder you just created.
25

25
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,490
So here I'm selecting this RNCOURSE folder
26

26
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:08,360
which I created before, and I'll open this in vscode.
27

27
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,340
So here I got this expo react-native project opened up
28

28
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,530
and you can of course configure the visuals,
29

29
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:18,440
the way vscode looks, however you want.
30

30
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,610
by going to view appearance, you can hide
31

31
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:25,620
or show the sidebar, the status bar at the bottom,
32

32
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,290
and you can also go to preferences
33

33
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,070
and then choose a color theme,
34

34
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:31,390
that suits your needs.
35

35
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:34,170
I'm using the dark plus theme here.
36

36
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,430
so you can configure this editor however you want
37

37
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,793
but what was created for us here?
38

38
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,850
Well, we see actually not too much.
39

39
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:47,080
We got two folders, expo-shared and vscode
40

40
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,397
which we can ignore,
41

41
00:01:48,397 --> 00:01:50,020
vscode just holds some settings
42

42
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,290
i configured for this workspace here,
43

43
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,520
And expo-shared simply just holds
44

44
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,870
some internally used information.
45

45
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,640
The assets folder will become important later,
46

46
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,280
because we can store images there.
47

47
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,250
For example, the icon of our app
48

48
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,103
but also images which be used inside our app.
49

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,020
And we got the node modules folder
50

50
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,510
which holds all the third party packages
51

51
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,960
that are used under the hood.
52

52
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,950
We got a package, Json file
53

53
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:19,350
which lists all the dependencies
54

54
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:20,550
of our project here.
55

55
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:23,040
And here For example, we see expo
56

56
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,440
because expo is not just the command line interface.
57

57
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,620
It's all so a JavaScript package which we can use,
58

58
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,360
and which we will use heavily as you see
59

59
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,810
because it gives us many utility functionalities
60

60
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:39,470
that make writing react-native code easier.
61

61
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,140
But you also see we're using react,
62

62
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:44,620
react-dom, react-native, and react-native-web,
63

63
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,600
though again, that's not the focus of this course.
64

64
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,620
You could build web apps with react-native
65

65
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,660
but support is a bit clunky.
66

66
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:55,080
And yeah, we're simply not focusing
67

67
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,090
on that because you could just use react itself.
68

68
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:01,470
If you want to do that together with react-dom.
69

69
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,890
React-dom of course therefore is also just here
70

70
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:05,713
because of react-native web.
71

71
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,240
So that's what we have here.
72

72
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,870
We also got a couple of script commands
73

73
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,150
which we could execute with NPM
74

74
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,450
but overall there's nothing fancy in here.
75

75
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:16,420
And you know, these kinds of files
76

76
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,430
if you worked with react before,
77

77
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,730
which you should have
78

78
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,350
because this course assumes
79

79
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:25,100
that you have react and JavaScript knowledge.
80

80
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,910
So that's the package, Json file .
81

81
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,990
Package-lock is related to that.
82

82
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:32,800
And the babbleconfigjs file just configures
83

83
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,980
how code is trans piled under the hood,
84

84
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,880
and unless you know what you're doing
85

85
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,847
you also shouldn't change this file therefore.
86

86
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,820
Now we do have the app Json file,
87

87
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,050
which will become important later
88

88
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:49,600
because here we can configure some settings
89

89
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,040
and behaviors of our react-native app.
90

90
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,260
And this is a file that will be picked up by expo.
91

91
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:59,260
When our app is built for preview
92

92
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,630
or for the actual app stores.
93

93
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,450
We can set the name here.
94

94
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,660
We can set some background colors here
95

95
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,750
and we will come back
96

96
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,360
to this file occasionally for configuration.
97

97
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,350
So this is a file, which we have because we're using expo.
98

98
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:16,230
And then we got App js.
99

99
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:19,570
This is the only real code file we have
100

100
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:22,070
in this starter project.
101

101
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:25,270
The exact content could change over time
102

102
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:27,740
to make sure that we're all on the same page.
103

103
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:31,000
I attached my App js file to this lecture
104

104
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,130
so that you can download it and replace yours with it
105

105
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:36,760
so that you have the same code as I have it.
106

106
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:40,163
Because we'll build up on this code in the next lectures.
107

107
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,500
This in here is a regular react component
108

108
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,080
which uses special components
109

109
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,850
special js x elements, exposed, bio-react-native.
110

110
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:53,900
That's what I mentioned before.
111

111
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,010
And then we got some styling which could look a bit weird
112

112
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,480
but I'll come back to how styling works
113

113
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,783
in react-native apps later.
114

114
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:05,750
So for the moment, this is our app code,
115

115
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:09,740
and now it would be nice to see this code in action.
116

116
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:13,733
For this, we need some device on which we can preview it.
