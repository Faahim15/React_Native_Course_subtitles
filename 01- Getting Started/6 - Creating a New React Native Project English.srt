1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,640
- So, therefore, back on this official React

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:07,000
- Native website, we can now follow the

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,580
- steps described here in the Expo tab to

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,600
- create a new Expo-driven React Native

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,140
- project.

6
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:19,060
- But I'll actually not start by running this

7
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:19,760
- command here.

8
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,880
- Instead, as a first step, you must make

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,440
- sure that you have Node.js installed on

10
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,120
- your system.

11
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,480
- And you can visit nodejs.org to

12
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,940
- download the latest LTS version from

13
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:32,280
- there.

14
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,960
- Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,040
- allows you to run JavaScript outside of

16
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:40,600
- the browser.

17
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,340
- And whilst we won't write any Node.js

18
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,720
- code in this course, this tool, this

19
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,780
- runtime, is in the end used under the

20
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:54,160
- hood by Expo and it's also required to

21
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,560
- unlock this npx command here, which

22
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,020
- you need to run to create new projects.

23
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,120
- That's why you must make sure that you

24
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,760
- got Node.js installed.

25
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,760
- With it installed, though, you can copy

26
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,900
- this npx create-expo command, which

27
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,060
- will be used to create new Expo-driven

28
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,540
- React Native projects.

29
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,760
- And you can and should then open your

30
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,360
- default system terminal or command

31
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,940
- prompt to run this command, though as

32
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,440
- a first step, you should make sure that

33
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,140
- there you navigate to a place on your

34
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,020
- machine where you want to create this

35
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:35,860
- new project.

36
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,160
- Once you did that, though, you can run

37
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:43,220
- npx create-expo to create a new

38
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,280
- Expo-driven React Native app, though I'll

39
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,000
- slightly tweak this command and add

40
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,600
- â€“template blank here as an option.

41
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,200
- This will ensure that we get a very basic

42
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,360
- project setup, which we can use to really

43
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,240
- start from scratch and learn about all

44
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,780
- these key features step by step.

45
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,039
- If you don't include this option, you'll get

46
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:12,640
- a more complex starting project, which

47
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,840
- also uses TypeScript by default and

48
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,560
- that's also something I don't wanna do

49
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,480
- here, because not everyone knows

50
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,620
- TypeScript, of course.

51
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,860
- So this option should be included and

52
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:27,140
- thereafter you specify your project

53
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:30,660
- name, like rnCourse for React Native

54
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,980
- Course, but this of course is up to you,

55
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:33,840
- this name.

56
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,160
- And this will then also be the name of a

57
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,860
- folder that will be created for you and it's

58
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,580
- in that folder where this project will be

59
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,160
- setup, once you hit enter.

60
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,920
- Now what's also worth mentioning at

61
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,160
- this point is that regarding Expo, you

62
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,360
- can also find a dedicated website

63
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,300
- provided by the team behind this Expo

64
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,380
- tool, expo.dev.

65
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,380
- And on that website you can of course

66
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,420
- learn more about Expo and also learn

67
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,820
- more about the Expo-related

68
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,240
- commands you can execute in the

69
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,440
- command line and about the features

70
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,980
- offered by Expo, though that is

71
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,020
- something we'll get back to throughout

72
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,920
- this course as we build React Native

73
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,640
- apps and as we also use Expo step by

74
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,060
- step.

75
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,180
- Now this command can take a while to

76
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,020
- finish, that's totally normal, because it

77
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,480
- will go ahead and setup that project and

78
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,240
- install all required dependencies, but at

79
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,940
- some point it will finish and once it is

80
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,880
- finished it typically will also show you

81
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,200
- some commands you could run to

82
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,880
- navigate into this newly created project

83
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:54,540
- folder and to then run this basic app

84
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,680
- that is created by default in that starting

85
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,380
- project on Android, on iOS or on the

86
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:05,220
- web, though in this course we'll ignore

87
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,300
- the web part.

88
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,540
- I do have a complete React course

89
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,100
- where I show you in detail how to work

90
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,160
- with React and how to use it to build

91
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,220
- web apps, in this course we'll focus on

92
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,880
- building Android and iOS apps with

93
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,959
- React Native.

94
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,740
- So therefore you could run these

95
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:26,700
- commands, but we'll not do that just yet.

96
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:30,540
- Instead as a next step let's open this

97
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,360
- newly created project and let's explore

98
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,140
- how it looks like and which kind of files

99
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:36,980
- we have in there.
