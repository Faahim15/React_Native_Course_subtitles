1
00:00:02,366 --> 00:00:06,000
- [Maximilian] Now, that's
it for React Native for now.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,700
Before we now really start
diving into React Native

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,633
and all its basics,

4
00:00:11,633 --> 00:00:14,400
let me briefly come back to this course

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,133
and give you an overview
of what you can expect

6
00:00:17,133 --> 00:00:18,366
from that course.

7
00:00:19,266 --> 00:00:21,000
Right now we're just getting started,

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,300
but we're pretty much done
with that and thereafter,

9
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,733
we're going to dive into

10
00:00:25,733 --> 00:00:29,166
all the React Native essentials you need.

11
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:30,966
In the next course section,

12
00:00:30,966 --> 00:00:33,266
we will dive into the basics,

13
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:36,100
into how you can build user interfaces

14
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,300
with React Native components,

15
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,200
how you can style your user interfaces,

16
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,700
how you can build powerful
layouts and of course,

17
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,300
we're also going to
practice all these things

18
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,866
by building real apps and thereafter,

19
00:00:49,866 --> 00:00:53,133
we're also going to learn
how we can add navigation,

20
00:00:53,133 --> 00:00:55,500
how we can make sure that users can switch

21
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,900
between different screens
with nice animations,

22
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,900
how you can add drawers or
tabs and things like that.

23
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:06,133
Now, this also has a
couple of prerequisites

24
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:09,600
to make sure that you get the
most out of all these concepts

25
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,700
out of all these sections,
and specifically,

26
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:17,300
you already need JavaScript
and React.js knowledge.

27
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,400
However, this course also comes

28
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,066
with two refresher course sections,

29
00:01:23,066 --> 00:01:25,600
which you find at the end of this course

30
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,433
to which you can jump ahead

31
00:01:27,433 --> 00:01:31,033
if you wanna go through
those refreshers again

32
00:01:31,033 --> 00:01:35,466
before you start diving into
all the React Native sections.

33
00:01:35,466 --> 00:01:40,466
These refreshers don't replace
full courses on these topics,

34
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:43,000
but they are great if it's been some time

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,800
since you last worked
with React for example,

36
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,633
and therefore it's my recommendation

37
00:01:47,633 --> 00:01:50,700
that you take a look at
those refresher sections

38
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,600
if you need them.

39
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,900
Now, after all those React
Native essentials though,

40
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,633
we're also going to dive
into more advanced features

41
00:01:59,633 --> 00:02:01,900
and specifically, we are going to learn

42
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:05,933
how we can connect
certain key React concepts

43
00:02:05,933 --> 00:02:08,266
with React Native,

44
00:02:08,266 --> 00:02:11,266
for example, how we
can use the context API

45
00:02:11,266 --> 00:02:13,866
or Redux with React Native.

46
00:02:13,866 --> 00:02:16,366
We're going to build
a complete example app

47
00:02:16,366 --> 00:02:19,466
from the ground up to
practice all these things

48
00:02:19,466 --> 00:02:20,900
we learned up to this point.

49
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,300
We will learn how to handle user input

50
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:27,633
and send HTTP requests and
all these things again,

51
00:02:27,633 --> 00:02:30,966
by building multiple realistic apps.

52
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:31,900
Last but

53
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,466
not least,
we will dove into many advanced modules as well

54
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,033
where we will focus on user authentication

55
00:02:39,266 --> 00:02:44,300
and learn how we can use
native device features like on device storage,

56
00:02:44,466 --> 00:02:49,900
the camera, locations,
for example, locating the user or showing a map

57
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:53,533
and we will
also learn how we could add push notifications.

58
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,666
Last but
not least, we will also learn how you can publish

59
00:02:57,666 --> 00:03:01,766
your React Native
apps, so how you can get them into the app stores.

60
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:05,466
Now, that's the course content.

61
00:03:05,466 --> 00:03:06,433
I also wanna make sure

62
00:03:06,433 --> 00:03:09,233
that you get the most
out of this course though

63
00:03:09,233 --> 00:03:11,966
and the most obvious
recommendation of course,

64
00:03:11,966 --> 00:03:13,866
is that you should watch the videos,

65
00:03:13,866 --> 00:03:16,966
because this is a video on-demand course,

66
00:03:16,966 --> 00:03:19,266
but of course, watching the videos means

67
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:22,266
that you should watch
them at your own pace.

68
00:03:22,266 --> 00:03:25,666
You can use the video controls
to speed the videos up

69
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:29,100
or slow them down and you
should take advantage of that

70
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,133
to make sure that you
get the most out of them.

71
00:03:32,133 --> 00:03:35,400
You can also pause videos to
practice something on your own,

72
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,366
even if I don't tell you
to practice something,

73
00:03:38,366 --> 00:03:40,400
definitely do this on your own as well,

74
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,666
and feel free to go back
to the beginning of a video

75
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:46,966
to re-watch a video or
even an entire section

76
00:03:46,966 --> 00:03:49,966
if something wasn't clear the
first time you watched it,

77
00:03:49,966 --> 00:03:52,366
because that is the huge advantage

78
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:54,833
of a video on-demand course.

79
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:57,900
So embrace that advantage.

80
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,966
In addition of course, in this course,

81
00:03:59,966 --> 00:04:01,633
we're going to build a lot of apps.

82
00:04:01,633 --> 00:04:03,366
We're going to write a lot of code

83
00:04:03,366 --> 00:04:06,466
and I recommend that you do code along,

84
00:04:06,466 --> 00:04:09,166
that you don't just watch the videos,

85
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:12,333
though you can of course
also just do that,

86
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:15,566
but you will learn more if
you also pause the videos,

87
00:04:15,566 --> 00:04:19,000
if you practice things on
your own, if you code along,

88
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,666
if you try to write the code on your own,

89
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:25,233
if you maybe even experiment
with the code a little bit

90
00:04:25,233 --> 00:04:27,966
and you write slightly different apps,

91
00:04:27,966 --> 00:04:32,366
you add extra features that I
might not add in the videos.

92
00:04:32,366 --> 00:04:36,100
Do all these things,
because that will ensure

93
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,766
that you get even more out of this course.

94
00:04:39,766 --> 00:04:43,466
Now, when following along
and when coding along,

95
00:04:43,466 --> 00:04:45,700
you will sometimes also get stuck.

96
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,500
You might not be able to reproduce

97
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,600
a certain result I'm showing in the videos

98
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,400
and for those cases or if you wanna,

99
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,866
for example, get the course slides,

100
00:04:56,866 --> 00:04:59,200
you should use the course attachments

101
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,266
that are also provided
as part of this course.

102
00:05:02,266 --> 00:05:06,266
To be precise, in the next
lecture after this one,

103
00:05:06,266 --> 00:05:09,200
you find a link to all
the course resources,

104
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,466
all the code snapshots and so on

105
00:05:11,466 --> 00:05:14,000
and you should use these resources

106
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,400
to compare your code to mine,

107
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,800
to maybe even replace your code with mine

108
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,800
or parts of your code
with mine if you're stuck

109
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,333
to make sure that you can
find plus fix your errors

110
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:28,233
that you might be facing.

111
00:05:28,233 --> 00:05:31,066
The next lecture also
contains instructions

112
00:05:31,066 --> 00:05:33,933
on how you can use the
provided code resources,

113
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:35,500
how you can download them,

114
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,966
how you can use them to
compare or replace your code.

115
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:43,933
Now last but not least, this
also has a Q & A section

116
00:05:43,933 --> 00:05:46,933
which you can use if you're
stuck, if you have questions,

117
00:05:46,933 --> 00:05:50,866
but don't just use this
section to ask questions,

118
00:05:50,866 --> 00:05:53,400
instead also try to help others,

119
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,366
because if you try to help
others, if you reply to others,

120
00:05:57,366 --> 00:05:59,800
you will get way more out of this course,

121
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,100
because when you solve
someone else's problem,

122
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:06,400
you are challenged to
come up with a solution,

123
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,400
to articulate that solution and
that will actually make sure

124
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,400
that you really get the
most out of this course,

125
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,800
that you have to understand the things

126
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,300
that I teach in this course

127
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,933
and that you fully understand them

128
00:06:21,933 --> 00:06:24,933
instead of just a little bit, for example.

129
00:06:24,933 --> 00:06:29,800
So definitely also use this
Q & A section to help others

130
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,333
and not just to ask for help.

131
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:35,633
That's my recommendation for this course.

132
00:06:35,633 --> 00:06:38,166
And with all these recommendations,

133
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:40,833
you will get a lot out of this course,

134
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:44,066
you will learn React
Native from the ground up

135
00:06:44,066 --> 00:06:48,100
in great detail and therefore,
in the next course section,

136
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:52,300
it's now time to really dive
into React Native in detail.
