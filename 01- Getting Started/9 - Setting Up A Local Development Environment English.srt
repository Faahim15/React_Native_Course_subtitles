1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,850
So, this is how easy it is to get started
2

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:06,980
with Expo and React Native.
3

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:08,650
You can easily create an app
4

4
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:10,490
and with help of the Expo Go App,
5

5
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:12,360
you can easily preview it.
6

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,570
And you might not need more for now.
7

7
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,116
You can now follow along
8

8
00:00:17,116 --> 00:00:21,180
and preview your app changes on your real device.
9

9
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,010
But maybe you don't want use your real device only.
10

10
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:26,870
Maybe you also have an iPhone
11

11
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:29,510
and you wanna also preview the app on Android
12

12
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:32,020
but you don't have an Android device.
13

13
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,290
For those reasons,
14

14
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:36,000
you might want to install a simulator
15

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,510
which is an extra piece of software that runs
16

16
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:43,780
on your local machine that simulates an iOS device
17

17
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,783
or an Android device.
18

18
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:50,050
Now, for this, you can search for Android studio,
19

19
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,470
to download Android studio to get such a piece
20

20
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:58,290
of software that allows you to run Android emulators
21

21
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:00,390
on your local machine.
22

22
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,710
On developer.android.com/studio.
23

23
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:06,320
You will find a download link that allows you
24

24
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,250
to download Android studio for your operating system.
25

25
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:14,690
And this can be downloaded for Mac Os and Windows.
26

26
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:16,800
Now the download can take a while
27

27
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,470
but make sure you do download and install it in order
28

28
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:24,690
to be able to run emulators on your local device.
29

29
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:27,330
Now for iOS, it's different.
30

30
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,870
There you must open the app store on Mac Os
31

31
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:33,000
and search for Xcode and download this Xcode tool
32

32
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,220
which is Apple's developer environment
33

33
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,750
for building iOS apps.
34

34
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,200
Unfortunately, this is not available
35

35
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,760
for Windows or Linux devices.
36

36
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,780
So if you are on a Windows or a Linux machine,
37

37
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:50,950
you can't run iOS simulators through Xcode.
38

38
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:54,170
This is a limitation applied by Apple.
39

39
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,520
So unfortunately on Windows or Linux
40

40
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,940
you can only build and test for Android.
41

41
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:03,940
Actually, you will be able to build real iOS apps as well
42

42
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,130
through some Cloud build service
43

43
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:08,130
about which I'll talk a little bit later
44

44
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:11,120
but when it comes to previewing the app on an iPhone
45

45
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,270
if you don't own a real iPhone
46

46
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,520
on which you can use the Expo go app
47

47
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,190
or a Mac Os device on which you can install Xcode
48

48
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,520
you have to focus on Android instead.
49

49
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,673
It is what it is.
50

50
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,950
Now, once you did install Android studio,
51

51
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:29,470
you can open it and you should see a welcome screen
52

52
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:32,070
that looks something like this and that should have
53

53
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,830
some more actions button.
54

54
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:38,453
And in there you will find a Virtual Device Manager.
55

55
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:43,280
You can use this manager to build virtual devices
56

56
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,343
so to build emulators.
57

57
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,100
So here I already have an emulator
58

58
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,290
but you can click on create device to build a new one.
59

59
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:55,760
And here you can select from a broad variety of presets
60

60
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,763
like the pixel five, for example, here.
61

61
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,690
Click next, then choose an Android version
62

62
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,620
that will run on this emulator.
63

63
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:10,690
And here I'll choose the API 32 version
64

64
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,800
which is the latest version in my case, click next
65

65
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,800
keep all the default settings here and click finish.
66

66
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,270
And now this will create such a new emulator.
67

67
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,160
And then you can click the play button
68

68
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,683
to launch this emulator.
69

69
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:30,560
And this will now launch this emulator on your device.
70

70
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,560
So on your Windows or Mac OS or Linux device.
71

71
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,153
I'll just increase it a little bit here.
72

72
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,340
So that's now an Android phone
73

73
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,290
so to say running on our computer.
74

74
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:46,000
Of course just a dummy phone, an emulator,
75

75
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
but a real phone when it comes to testing Android apps.
76

76
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,730
Now I will show you how to run this app
77

77
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:56,080
on this emulator in just a second.
78

78
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,870
First, I wanna show you how it would work
79

79
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,090
for Xcode and Mac OS.
80

80
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:03,770
Which as mentioned only works on Mac OS.
81

81
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:07,620
Here in Xcode you wanna open this as well.
82

82
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,380
You don't have to open a project.
83

83
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,110
You just need to open Xcode,
84

84
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:14,070
and then you should go to the preferences there.
85

85
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:17,520
In the preferences make sure you go to locations
86

86
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,430
and here under command line tools
87

87
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:23,400
make sure you have a version selected here.
88

88
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,370
By default no version is selected
89

89
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:28,853
and you should do that then select a version here.
90

90
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,090
Once this is done, you can close it.
91

91
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:37,793
And then we can go back here to our Expo app in Vs Code.
92

92
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:42,280
Now I used the terminal to run this NPM start process.
93

93
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,610
And this process is still running.
94

94
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:47,170
You should by the way keep this process running
95

95
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:50,010
as long as you are working on your code.
96

96
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:53,830
If you quit this process, your code is not watched anymore.
97

97
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,270
Preview builds are not built anymore
98

98
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,730
and they are not pushed
99

99
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:01,410
to your connected real devices or simulators anymore.
100

100
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:05,050
You can always quit this process by pressing control + C
101

101
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:08,070
and you can then restart it by running MPM start again.
102

102
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,780
But as long as your writing code
103

103
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,740
you should keep it running.
104

104
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,430
Now in there, we have this QR code
105

105
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:18,230
which we could scan to use the Expo go app on a real device
106

106
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:21,950
but we can also press A to run it on Android
107

107
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:24,940
or I to run it on iOS and it will pick
108

108
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:29,910
those running simulators or start a simulator for you.
109

109
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,220
Nonetheless it doesn't hurt
110

110
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,370
to already start an Android simulator
111

111
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:36,920
as I did it here so that I can then press A.
112

112
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,540
And now this is opening this on Android.
113

113
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,710
So this app is now built and previewed
114

114
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,523
on this Android emulator.
115

115
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,310
Now, in case you're getting an error
116

116
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,920
like this that is most likely related
117

117
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,790
to the emulator you created.
118

118
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,340
You might wanna create a new emulator
119

119
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,960
and make sure that you create one
120

120
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,230
or that you pick a template that has this placed or icon.
121

121
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:03,250
Because Expo needs to be able to access this play store.
122

122
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,230
So the play store must be part
123

123
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:08,740
of the emulator in order to download this Expo go app
124

124
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:12,550
which is used for previewing onto this emulator.
125

125
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:16,590
So use an emulator template that has this icon
126

126
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:19,240
then still the latest version, all the defaults
127

127
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,653
and create this emulator and start that emulator.
128

128
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:27,100
So now I'm launching a new emulator based
129

129
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,510
on this new template here.
130

130
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:32,403
And once this finish starting,
131

131
00:06:32,403 --> 00:06:35,870
we can again restart NPM-Start maybe,
132

132
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:40,140
and then press A again to find this emulator,
133

133
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,680
it will be found automatically by Expo
134

134
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,980
and then it will install this Expo go app
135

135
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:48,203
onto this emulator and open our app there as well.
136

136
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:51,420
We get this info screen, which we can close.
137

137
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,450
We get this debug screen here
138

138
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:55,930
which we can use to reload the app, for example
139

139
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:58,460
or turn on certain debugging tools.
140

140
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,680
But I will we'll come back to debugging later.
141

141
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,720
We can close this for now and see our app here.
142

142
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,963
So that's Android.
143

143
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:08,420
Now for iOS development you should go
144

144
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,680
to your applications and locate Xcode
145

145
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,953
and show the package contents off that.
146

146
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:18,430
Because in there in contents, developer, applications
147

147
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:21,500
you will find this simulator app.
148

148
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,690
And you can double click on this to start an iOS simulator.
149

149
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:30,300
Now, in this case, it's an iPhone 13 simulator.
150

150
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,650
You can change this by clicking on it and going
151

151
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:36,080
to the menu and then under file open simulator
152

152
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,250
you can choose all kinds of devices.
153

153
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,833
But I'll go with iPhone 13 here,
154

154
00:07:41,927 --> 00:07:44,270
and we can all increase this in size
155

155
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,680
to make that a bit easier to view.
156

156
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,490
And now we can press I here.
157

157
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:52,660
You don't even need to restart NPM start.
158

158
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:57,380
You can serve the preview on Android and iOS simultaneously.
159

159
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,340
So I just served it on Android.
160

160
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:04,120
Now I will press I to also started on the iOS simulator
161

161
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,440
which also should be detected automatically.
162

162
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,550
And now Expo will also install the Expo go app
163

163
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:13,460
on that simulator and open this app
164

164
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,730
in that Expo go app on our simulator.
165

165
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:20,670
So here it's opening up and after a short while
166

166
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,550
and it only takes that long initially
167

167
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:25,130
when this is all first installed and set up,
168

168
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,590
of course, after a short while we will see
169

169
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:31,860
our app preview on this device as well.
170

170
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,820
Here we go, it's loading up now
171

171
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:38,310
and now we see Hello World here as well.
172

172
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:41,220
So now we can preview our little application
173

173
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,690
on a real device as I showed it to you a couple
174

174
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,183
of minutes ago, and on those simulators like this.
175

175
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,070
And this process here should always stay up
176

176
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,020
and running as long as your writing code.
177

177
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,690
So we'll just make it smaller.
178

178
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:56,300
And now we can change our code
179

179
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,030
add a couple of exclamation marks.
180

180
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,980
And if we save this file,
181

181
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,290
this is automatically picked up and reloaded
182

182
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:04,933
on those apps without us doing anything.
183

183
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:09,490
You can still manually reload it though by pressing R
184

184
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:12,010
in this running terminal here
185

185
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:15,050
this will then manually reload those apps.
186

186
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:17,110
And that's the development environment
187

187
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:19,460
we will use for Discourse.
188

188
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:23,400
This is now what we need to dive deeper into React Native.
189

189
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,893
And Discourse here.
