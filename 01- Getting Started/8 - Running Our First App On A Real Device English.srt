1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,340
So we got our code opened up here.
2

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:06,830
We created this project with Expo.
3

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:10,140
Now it would be nice to preview our app because of course,
4

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,580
whilst we're working on the React Native app,
5

5
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,670
we want to constantly preview it
6

6
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,470
so that we can see our changes
7

7
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,940
and tweak the app as required.
8

8
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:22,269
It would basically be nice to have the same kind of workflow
9

9
00:00:22,269 --> 00:00:24,630
or a comparable workflow
10

10
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,160
as we have it with the browser and just React
11

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,310
when we're building React Web apps.
12

12
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:32,650
There, we can also create a React project
13

13
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:34,600
and preview it in the browser.
14

14
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,250
Now thankfully, since we're using Expo,
15

15
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:41,973
previewing our app on a real device is super easy.
16

16
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:46,110
You just need an Android device or an iPhone.
17

17
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,570
In my case, I have an iPhone here,
18

18
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,790
but the same is true for Android,
19

19
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:53,380
and you visit the app store there.
20

20
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:56,933
And in the app store, you can search for Expo.
21

21
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,140
Now, you should find a Expo Go app.
22

22
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,970
This is an app provided by the company behind the Expo CLI
23

23
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,883
and this Expo package, which is part of our project here.
24

24
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,420
So you can now download this app onto your device.
25

25
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:17,060
This app is available for the iPhone
26

26
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,290
and for Android devices.
27

27
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,873
And once downloaded, you can open it.
28

28
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:27,650
Now in here, you can preview your Expo apps
29

29
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:31,350
that are built on your local computer.
30

30
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:34,140
To do that, you should open up your terminal
31

31
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,180
or command prompt.
32

32
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:38,330
Here, I'm using the one integrated into VS Code.
33

33
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:40,440
You can open this by going to terminal here
34

34
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,820
and opening a new terminal.
35

35
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,190
And this is the default system terminal integrated here
36

36
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:47,350
into your VS Code.
37

37
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:50,893
And then in here you can run npm-start.
38

38
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,330
Now, what this will do,
(device chiming)
39

39
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:57,610
is it will actually start the Expo Development Server
40

40
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,690
which watches and builds our code
41

41
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,400
and which builds our code,
42

42
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,060
basically such that we can preview it.
43

43
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:07,280
And it also gives us a QR code here.
44

44
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,730
You can scan this QR code with your Expo app on Android,
45

45
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:12,610
not on iOS.
46

46
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:13,850
I'll come back to this in a second,
47

47
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:17,140
but on Android, you will have a barcode scanner,
48

48
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,941
a button that allows you to scan this barcode
49

49
00:02:19,941 --> 00:02:22,823
in your Expo Go app which you downloaded.
50

50
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,650
In addition, you also should have a browser tab
51

51
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:31,030
that opened up where you also find this barcode,
52

52
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:34,800
and where you will find log messages printed by Expo
53

53
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,323
as your app is running.
54

54
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,690
Now on the iPhone, the scanner is not integrated
55

55
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,640
into the Expo app.
56

56
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,940
Instead, there you need to open your camera
57

57
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:49,860
and then scan this barcode here or the one in the terminal.
58

58
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,140
And then once you tap to open the link
59

59
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,460
that is sent by that barcode, you should click Open,
60

60
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,313
which opens the Expo Go app.
61

61
00:02:58,940 --> 00:02:59,830
Then you should grant
62

62
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:01,140
any permissions the app might
(device chiming)
63

63
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,183
be asking for.
64

64
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,490
And now you see here that the JavaScript bundle
65

65
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:08,420
is being built.
66

66
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,240
So the Expo app is being built.
67

67
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,860
The React Native app based on Expo is built
68

68
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:16,950
and it opens up in this simulator on our real device here.
69

69
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:19,100
So in this Expo Go app here.
70

70
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,770
We can close this info screen.
71

71
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:24,690
And now here, we see our app which we're building
72

72
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:27,883
on our local machine running on a real device.
73

73
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:32,910
Now we can tell that this is our app by changing this text.
74

74
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:36,827
If I remove all the text here, and instead I say,
75

75
00:03:36,827 --> 00:03:41,827
"Hello, World," good old "Hello, World" message,
76

76
00:03:42,731 --> 00:03:45,083
and I then save this file,
77

77
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:49,320
you will see that it basically instantly updates
78

78
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,290
on your phone as well in this Expo Go app
79

79
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,530
which we use for previewing.
80

80
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:57,900
And this is how simple it is to build
81

81
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,610
and test those Expo based React Native apps
82

82
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:04,750
with the Expo Go app and why it's so recommended
83

83
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,870
to use this Expo workflow.
84

84
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,030
It simply makes building
85

85
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:11,510
and testing React Native apps much easier.
86

86
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:14,750
And this still is a React Native app here.
87

87
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:18,233
We're just using Expo to make our life a bit easier.
