1
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:07,230
So, what exactly is React Native?
2

2
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:12,330
Well, as the name applies, it is related to React.js.
3

3
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:16,540
And with React.js and React Native,
4

4
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:20,810
you can build real React Native based mobile apps
5

5
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:22,670
for iOS and Android,
6

6
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:26,010
which are real apps you can distribute
7

7
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,910
through the app stores and apps that can be used
8

8
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:32,800
by any user with an iOS or Android device.
9

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,910
Now React.js is a library that's independent
10

10
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:39,240
from React Native though.
11

11
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,090
React.js is a JavaScript library
12

12
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,030
for building user interfaces.
13

13
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,430
And it is typically used for web development.
14

14
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:52,626
That's also the environment for which it was first created.
15

15
00:00:52,626 --> 00:00:56,180
But actually, if you worked with React.js,
16

16
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:00,450
you might know that there, it's actually another library
17

17
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:05,353
the React DOM library that adds the actual web support
18

18
00:01:05,353 --> 00:01:10,353
because React itself, the library React itself,
19

19
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:14,830
without React DOM is platform-agnostic,
20

20
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:17,251
which means you can use React
21

21
00:01:17,251 --> 00:01:21,160
in conjunction with React DOM to build web apps,
22

22
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:25,050
but React the library itself, actually does not care
23

23
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,300
about the underlying platform.
24

24
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,750
React just gives you tools for managing state,
25

25
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,640
for building virtual component trees,
26

26
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,380
and then you need an extra library like React DOM
27

27
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,496
for translating the result React produced
28

28
00:01:41,496 --> 00:01:45,680
to an actual platform like the browser.
29

29
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,330
Now, React Native is basically
30

30
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:52,440
an alternative to React DOM, therefore.
31

31
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,630
React Native gives you a collection
32

32
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,350
of special react components,
33

33
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,180
which you can use in your JSX code.
34

34
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,840
So React Native ships with built-in components you can use.
35

35
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:09,840
And those components are then compiled to native UI elements
36

36
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,170
for the iOS and Android platforms,
37

37
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:16,290
and React Native will also take care
38

38
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:19,350
about this compilation step.
39

39
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,030
In addition, React Native
40

40
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:25,470
also exposes certain native platform APIs
41

41
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,890
like using the device camera
42

42
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:32,186
so that you can use such features in your JavaScript code
43

43
00:02:32,186 --> 00:02:34,220
even though you need to tap
44

44
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,520
into native device APIs for that.
45

45
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,880
And therefore in the end, React Native is like React DOM.
46

46
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:46,640
It just does not target the web, the browser as a platform,
47

47
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,320
but instead iOS and Android.
48

48
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,720
And React Native gives you
49

49
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,820
all the components and the APIs you need to interact
50

50
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:59,400
with those platforms and to build apps for those platforms.
51

51
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,520
That is what React Native is all about.
52

52
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,430
And therefore, in order to work with React Native,
53

53
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:09,570
you also must know React.js
54

54
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:12,660
because you will write your code in React.js
55

55
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:16,670
and then just use these extra React Native components
56

56
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:20,637
and APIs in your React JavaScript code
57

57
00:03:20,637 --> 00:03:23,578
to produce those native mobile apps
58

58
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,763
for iOS and Android.
