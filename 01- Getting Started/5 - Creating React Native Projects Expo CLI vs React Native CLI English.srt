1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,080
- So, I'd say that's enough theory for now.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,920
- Let's get started with React Native and

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,520
- let's create a new React Native project.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,300
- And to get started, you can simply

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:16,140
- search for React Native and you should

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,880
- find the official web page

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,480
- reactnative.dev.

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,300
- And on that page, you can then of

9
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,200
- course learn more about React Native

10
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,300
- and it therefore is a great resource to use

11
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,600
- in addition to this course, also to dive

12
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,040
- deeper.

13
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:36,360
- But you can also use this site to get

14
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,540
- started and to create new React Native

15
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,220
- projects.

16
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,880
- And that is what we'll do here.

17
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,200
- So if you click on get started, you should

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,360
- be taken to this setting up the

19
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,180
- development environment page here.

20
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,520
- If you're not, you can visit it manually by

21
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,040
- navigating to it here on the sidebar on

22
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,520
- the left.

23
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,560
- And on this page, you'll find two main

24
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,700
- approaches you can use for creating

25
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,640
- new React Native projects.

26
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,100
- And the approach that is selected by

27
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,960
- default and that's therefore

28
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,280
- recommended also by me is to use a

29
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,700
- tool called Expo and to use its CLI, its

30
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,700
- command line interface to create new

31
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,080
- projects in the end and to manage these

32
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:24,700
- projects.

33
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,840
- Alternatively, you could also use a tool

34
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,080
- called the React Native CLI, which you

35
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,020
- could also use to create React Native

36
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:34,560
- projects.

37
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,360
- But as you'll also see in this course, this

38
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,600
- Expo tool simply makes the process of

39
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,740
- creating and managing and building

40
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,360
- React Native apps a lot easier.

41
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:49,240
- That's why we will also use this approach

42
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,760
- in this course, just as it's essentially

43
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,960
- recommended on the official page here.

44
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:57,900
- But what's the difference between these

45
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,700
- two approaches?

46
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,140
- Why do we have two approaches?

47
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,960
- We have the Expo CLI and the React

48
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,340
- Native CLI.

49
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:09,400
- CLI stands for command line interface

50
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:13,640
- and both tools are tools that exist in

51
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,420
- order to help you create React Native

52
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:19,560
- projects and run React Native apps on

53
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,980
- testing devices and simulators, as well as

54
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,720
- build React Native apps so that you can

55
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,120
- ship them to the app stores.

56
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,560
- So these are the tools you need to really

57
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,400
- build apps and to get those packages,

58
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,800
- those distributable packages, which you

59
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,680
- can upload to the app stores.

60
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,520
- These two tools are crucial, but you don't

61
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,600
- need to use them both.

62
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,440
- You can use either of the two and one

63
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,440
- tool is enough.

64
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,560
- But why do we have these two tools and

65
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,440
- what's the difference?

66
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:57,060
- Well, the Expo CLI, or just Expo, as I will

67
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,920
- also call it throughout the course, and

68
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,280
- the company behind this CLI is in the

69
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,760
- end a third-party service that you can

70
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,400
- use, a service that is entirely free.

71
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,980
- You don't have to sign up, you don't have

72
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:10,700
- to pay for it.

73
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,100
- You can sign up and you can pay.

74
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,680
- They do offer extra paid services, but to

75
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,080
- build React Native apps and to ship

76
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,940
- them, you don't need to pay.

77
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,840
- When using Expo, the CLI and a couple

78
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,260
- of other free tools, which they give you,

79
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,800
- you get a managed app development

80
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,020
- workflow, as I like to call it, which means

81
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:38,640
- creating projects is easy, writing code is

82
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,760
- a bit easier, tapping into native device

83
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,160
- functionalities like using the device

84
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,420
- camera and so on is easier.

85
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,860
- And in general, when using Expo, the

86
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,900
- Expo CLI and also a couple of other tools

87
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,600
- provided by Expo, writing native apps

88
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,500
- with React Native is more convenient

89
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,580
- than with just the React Native CLI and

90
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,380
- without Expo.

91
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,140
- There is less friction to this process.

92
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,740
- And the best thing is that you can still

93
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,740
- leave this Expo approach and ecosystem

94
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,560
- anytime if you need to.

95
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,220
- If you start by using Expo because it's

96
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,959
- easier to get started with that, and then

97
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,260
- at a later point, you find out that you

98
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,020
- want to switch to just using the React

99
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:30,200
- Native CLI workflow and not using Expo,

100
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,620
- you can do this anytime.

101
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,660
- That's why it's also the default selection

102
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,560
- to start with Expo because it's easier and

103
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,080
- you can still switch anytime you want to.

104
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,660
- Now why do we have the React Native

105
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:43,380
- CLI then?

106
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,960
- Well, because it existed before we had

107
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,580
- Expo, because this is the tool provided

108
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,840
- by the React Native team and the

109
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,540
- community around React Native.

110
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,820
- It gives you a bare bone React Native

111
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,100
- development setup, which means you

112
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,280
- will need to do more configuration and

113
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,740
- setup work on your own.

114
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,940
- There are less convenience features and

115
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:10,120
- if you need to tap into certain native

116
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,960
- device features like using the camera or

117
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,020
- other features, then it is often a bit more

118
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,800
- work when not having Expo around.

119
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,400
- Because as mentioned before, Expo is

120
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,740
- not just about the tool that creates

121
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,320
- projects.

122
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,520
- It will also give you helpful packages and

123
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,720
- tools that you can use when writing

124
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,360
- code that will make your life easier in

125
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,420
- that case as well.

126
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,380
- Now what the pure React Native

127
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,920
- workflow does have though, is that it is

128
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,840
- often a bit easier to integrate with native

129
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,820
- source code.

130
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,780
- So with source code written in Java or

131
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,420
- Objective-C or Swift or Kotlin.

132
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:54,280
- So if you must mix JavaScript code and

133
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,700
- native device source code, then using

134
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,520
- just the React Native CLI could be

135
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,120
- beneficial.

136
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,040
- But the idea behind React Native is that

137
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,340
- you don't have to do this too often and

138
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,960
- therefore this might not really be an

139
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,400
- advantage.

140
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,840
- And for all these reasons, and especially

141
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,840
- since you can switch anytime if you

142
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,720
- need to, we will use Expo in this course.

143
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,480
- As you will see, it's super easy to get

144
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,620
- started with that and it will make

145
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:24,080
- building React Native apps much easier.
