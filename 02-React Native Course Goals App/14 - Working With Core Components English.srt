1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,720
So let's start by diving deeper
2

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,453
into core components like Text and View.
3

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:11,430
And for this I'll actually delete this status bar component
4

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:12,823
and also this import.
5

5
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,160
If I save that, this is updated here on those devices
6

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,963
and not much change here, so we don't need this right now.
7

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,170
I also will delete this Text component and save that,
8

8
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,253
so that for now we have a blank screen.
9

9
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,517
And now let's try re adding the text like this,
10

10
00:00:34,517 --> 00:00:36,670
"Hello World" between the View,
11

11
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,823
without the surrounding text.
12

12
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:44,223
If we do that, we notice that we get an error down here.
13

13
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,167
We get an error that
14

14
00:00:46,167 --> 00:00:49,943
"Text strengths must be rendered within a Text component"
15

15
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:54,200
which is actually a quite helpful error message
16

16
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,310
which tells us in a pretty clear way, what's wrong.
17

17
00:00:58,310 --> 00:00:59,920
And before we fix this,
18

18
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,020
let's also take a look at those devices,
19

19
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,660
those simulators,
20

20
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,303
and here we also get the same error message.
21

21
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,780
And this is actually something important
22

22
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,750
which is why I'm showing this.
23

23
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,970
It's different than what you might know
24

24
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:15,750
from web development.
25

25
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,950
If you would build a web app,
26

26
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,350
and this would be react for the web
27

27
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:23,610
and this would maybe be a div instead of a View,
28

28
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,770
then this kind of code would be fine.
29

29
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,603
We could put text inside of a div there.
30

30
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,270
React Native and native platforms to be precise
31

31
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:36,760
are stricter than that.
32

32
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,200
You can't put a Text into a View
33

33
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,080
which is pretty much the equivalent to a div
34

34
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,853
because it's not meant for that.
35

35
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:51,840
Instead Views, so the of to divs in the web world,
36

36
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:56,140
Views are meant to generally build boxes
37

37
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:00,690
and containers that hold other content.
38

38
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:05,430
A View could hold some text wrapped into a Text component.
39

39
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,500
It could also hold a TextInput or a button
40

40
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,153
or an image, or anything like this,
41

41
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,890
but you have to put the content
42

42
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:19,010
into an element that is able to display it.
43

43
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:22,660
And the View is only able to hold other components,
44

44
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,050
It's not able to display text,
45

45
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:28,920
and that is something really important to understand.
46

46
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,800
If you wanna display a text, for example,
47

47
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,350
you have to use this Text component
48

48
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:39,350
and wrap the text opening and closing text around your text.
49

49
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,810
And if you do this and save, then this updates
50

50
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:47,730
and works again, but that's a first important takeaway
51

51
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:52,730
even though we can kind of compare those component to HTML.
52

52
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,460
And even though it looks kind of similar,
53

53
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,350
there are important differences.
54

54
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:01,640
Now, what you will often do when building React Native apps
55

55
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,960
is you will build more complex user interfaces
56

56
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,640
that don't just have one piece of text inside of them.
57

57
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,940
And what's important to understand then
58

58
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,530
is that those different core components
59

59
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,113
have different roles.
60

60
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,630
The Text is a component that's used for, guess what?
61

61
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,993
Displaying text.
62

62
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:25,370
The View is a component that's meant to hold
63

63
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:29,240
and lay out other components.
64

64
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,640
Now, we will learn more about laying things out
65

65
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,180
with help of styling in a couple of minutes,
66

66
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,360
but the idea behind the View component is that
67

67
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,580
you typically have multiple child components in there.
68

68
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,057
For example, another text,
69

69
00:03:42,057 --> 00:03:45,107
"Another piece of text".
70

70
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,340
In a Text component, as you learned,
71

71
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,340
but now we got two of them.
72

72
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,440
And we grouped them together in a View
73

73
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,060
just as we might group them together in a div
74

74
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,513
if this would be for the web.
75

75
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,210
Now, in the web, we also have other components like section
76

76
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:04,940
or article, here in React Native world,
77

77
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,690
it's just the View.
78

78
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:09,010
This is our container component
79

79
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:12,010
that we use for holding our components.
80

80
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:15,350
And of course, those other components also can be nested.
81

81
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,890
We could have another View
82

82
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:20,280
which actually holds this inner text.
83

83
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,740
So this is all something that's totally fine,
84

84
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,793
something you will typically build when building
85

85
00:04:24,793 --> 00:04:28,853
more complex user interfaces with React Native.
86

86
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:33,310
The View then makes it very easy to use styling
87

87
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:36,100
into which we'll dive in a second to control
88

88
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,913
where which of its child elements should be positioned.
89

89
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:44,950
Of course, we don't just have a View and Text to though.
90

90
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:47,530
If you take a look at the official website,
91

91
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:50,380
the official React Native documentation site
92

92
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,120
you'll learn that there are more
93

93
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,110
React Native core components
94

94
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:57,290
and those components fulfill different purposes.
95

95
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:00,690
We got View and Text, which are two of the most important
96

96
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,700
and commonly used components,
97

97
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:06,270
but we also could display a image, add some scrolling,
98

98
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,210
something will do later as well,
99

99
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:13,050
or add a TextInput which allows users to enter some text.
100

100
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,053
We could also add a button,
101

101
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,520
and indeed, that is what I'll do here.
102

102
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,950
Below this text, I'll add a button,
103

103
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:24,650
but for this, we need to import it.
104

104
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,300
And that is also important
105

105
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:30,630
and an important difference compared to react for the web.
106

106
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:34,050
With react for the web, you don't need to import
107

107
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,640
the HTL elements you might be using,
108

108
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,520
with React Native, you do.
109

109
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,320
If you wanna display a button,
110

110
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,270
you have to import this core component from React Native,
111

111
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,920
and then you can add your button.
112

112
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:50,150
And number important difference is that unlike for the web,
113

113
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,850
you don't build a button like this
114

114
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:56,350
by adding the caption between the opening and closing tags.
115

115
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,890
Instead, it's a self-closing element
116

116
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:01,440
where you add a title prop,
117

117
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,063
and then you add your title here.
118

118
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,570
This would now display a button as well
119

119
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,440
with the kind of default styling
120

120
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,210
and tap effects you would expect
121

121
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:15,350
for the different platforms.
122

122
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,350
And you see that the look adjusts
123

123
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,110
to the underlying platform.
124

124
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:21,410
It looks like an iOS button on iOS,
125

125
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,610
and like an Android button on Android.
126

126
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:26,000
But of course the button doesn't do anything yet
127

127
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,640
because I have added any listener.
128

128
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,710
Now, we will add interactivity,
129

129
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:32,870
and learn how that works later.
130

130
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,210
For the moment, let's just add the button here
131

131
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:38,240
and let's understand that we always work
132

132
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,130
with core components like this
133

133
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:44,630
where every component has its clearly defined purpose,
134

134
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:49,400
and you build your overall UI by combining those components.
135

135
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,510
But of course a UI is not just about combining components,
136

136
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,890
it's also about styling them,
137

137
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:58,103
and that's therefore what will explore next.
