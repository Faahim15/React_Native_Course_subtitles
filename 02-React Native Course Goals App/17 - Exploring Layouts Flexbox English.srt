1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,300
So let's explore how we can build
2

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:07,810
real layouts where we don't just have a bunch of
3

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:10,900
centered texts and buttons.
4

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:15,900
And for this, I will actually clean up my JSX content
5

5
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,210
and I will remove this style prop here
6

6
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:22,120
on the outer view for the moment
7

7
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,280
and remove all the styling here in this style sheet object
8

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,233
but I will keep the style sheet object.
9

9
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,610
And now here in my view,
10

10
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:32,670
I actually wanna add a neverview
11

11
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,773
and below that a neverview.
12

12
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:37,040
Now I'm doing this because
13

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,640
I wanna start building a basic interface here
14

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,610
that allows us to manage goals.
15

15
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,930
And the first view,
16

16
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,760
the first nested view here I should say,
17

17
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,000
should actually hold the input area
18

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,360
where users can enter the text for their goal
19

19
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,750
and click a button to add that goal.
20

20
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,160
And the second view should later hold the list of goals
21

21
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,760
that are rendered.
22

22
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,890
And I'm using two views as rappers
23

23
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:08,650
to have a clear separation between these two areas,
24

24
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:11,570
and because data will help me with styling.
25

25
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:13,130
So for this, I'll then therefore start
26

26
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:17,010
by adding a text input component here in the first view.
27

27
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:20,020
This is a component that allows users to enter text
28

28
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:23,830
and like all components, all core components,
29

29
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:26,363
we need to import it from react-native.
30

30
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:30,900
Now text input is a self-closing component.
31

31
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,430
And here we can, for example, add some placeholder text
32

32
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:38,790
as you could add it to a input element in the web
33

33
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,483
and say, your course goal.
34

34
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,020
Then, next to it I want to add a button
35

35
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:50,433
with the title of add goal.
36

36
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,880
And then here in this view, I will add a text element
37

37
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,640
where I say, list of goals
38

38
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,923
and later this will become a real list.
39

39
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,510
Now, if we save all of that,
40

40
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:06,220
we see that everything is crunched here at the top.
41

41
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:09,030
We also see that it goes beneath the status bar
42

42
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,280
and there would be different ways of fixing this.
43

43
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,300
For the moment, I'll fix it
44

44
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,720
by giving this outer view a style prop
45

45
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,543
and defining a style, which I'll name, app container.
46

46
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,490
And in there I'll add a padding of, let's say, 50 pixels.
47

47
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,920
And then here we can refer to styles.appContainer
48

48
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,533
to add to this padding to the overall outer view.
49

49
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,040
Now, if you save this,
50

50
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,400
we can see that there's more space around our UI.
51

51
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,630
Again, later, we will learn about different ways
52

52
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,500
of making sure that we don't interfere
53

53
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,190
with those native status bars and so on.
54

54
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:50,030
Now, still, this is not the layout I want.
55

55
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:53,260
For example, I want the button to be next to this input,
56

56
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,900
not beneath it.
57

57
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,500
I also want to have more space between the list of goals
58

58
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,700
and maybe this area where we add a goal
59

59
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,710
should take up a quarter of the overall height
60

60
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:07,130
and the list should take up the rest.
61

61
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:10,620
And that's where we need new styling features.
62

62
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,410
Styling properties about which we haven't learned before.
63

63
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:17,253
Specifically, we need flex box.
