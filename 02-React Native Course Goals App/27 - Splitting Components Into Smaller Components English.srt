1
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:03,693
So by now, we already learned
2

2
00:00:03,693 --> 00:00:06,630
a lot about important React Native components
3

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:08,490
and concepts in general.
4

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,580
Our app JS file is getting bigger and bigger.
5

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,350
And this is something that happens in most React apps,
6

6
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:16,540
no matter if you're building for React Native,
7

7
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:18,343
or if you're building for the web.
8

8
00:00:19,328 --> 00:00:21,970
Your components get bigger as you add more functionality.
9

9
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:25,960
Now, what do in such cases is you break up your components
10

10
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,010
and you split them into smaller components.
11

11
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,130
That is a common approach and a common best practice
12

12
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,200
for keeping your code maintainable.
13

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,120
And it's no difference here for React Native.
14

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,330
Thus far we're working with one component only
15

15
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:43,080
but this of course is the exception.
16

16
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,510
The norm is that you do work with multiple components.
17

17
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:48,403
And we wanna do that here as well.
18

18
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,960
For this, I'll add a new folder in my project
19

19
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,400
which I'll name "components"
20

20
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,010
because I wanna store my components in there.
21

21
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,700
You don't have to use this name
22

22
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,430
but it is a common convention
23

23
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:03,088
since we will be building and storing components in there.
24

24
00:01:03,088 --> 00:01:06,690
And then I want to add two components files in there.
25

25
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:08,480
Goal input JS,
26

26
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,190
because there I plan to store
27

27
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:15,190
the data input related JSX code and functionality.
28

28
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:18,320
And goal item JS,
29

29
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,470
here I plan to store the actual JSX code
30

30
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,700
and functionality that is related
31

31
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,513
without putting single goal items.
32

32
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:31,210
And of course you could split this into more components,
33

33
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:32,950
if you wanted to.
34

34
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:36,044
Now I'll start working on this goal item component.
35

35
00:01:36,044 --> 00:01:38,850
In there I'll add a function goal item
36

36
00:01:39,688 --> 00:01:41,280
because I'll create a functional component
37

37
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,753
and I will export this as a default.
38

38
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,263
So I will build a standard React component in there.
39

39
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,610
Now you don't need to import React from React here.
40

40
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:54,090
You did need to do that in the past
41

41
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,140
but with the modern versions of React Native and React
42

42
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,850
you don't need to do that anymore
43

43
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:00,990
and therefore a functional component
44

44
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,773
can be created just like this.
45

45
00:02:04,528 --> 00:02:05,480
Now in this goal item component,
46

46
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,640
I wanna return some JSX code
47

47
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,470
and I actually wanna return the code
48

48
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:12,470
that is responsible for outputting a single goal item.
49

49
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:15,430
So not the list of items, but a single item.
50

50
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,700
And that means I wanna use this code here.
51

51
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,524
Hence, I will cut this code from app JS
52

52
00:02:21,524 --> 00:02:24,953
and return it here in goal item JS.
53

53
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:29,830
Now, of course, here, I'm referring to some styles though
54

54
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:34,230
and those styles therefore also should be brought over.
55

55
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:37,760
For this I have to create a new style sheet object
56

56
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,224
that belongs to this component.
57

57
00:02:40,224 --> 00:02:41,540
So to this component file also
58

58
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:46,360
and hence I will import from React Native
59

59
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:51,360
and I will import the style sheet object here.
60

60
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:54,310
Which allows me to call the create method,
61

61
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:59,310
which creates a new React Native managed styling object,
62

62
00:02:59,396 --> 00:03:01,690
which helps with auto completion and so on.
63

63
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:04,370
I'll store this in a constant named styles,
64

64
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:06,712
though the name is up to you,
65

65
00:03:06,712 --> 00:03:09,596
but since I'm already referring to this kind of constant
66

66
00:03:09,596 --> 00:03:10,479
here in my code,
67

67
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:12,050
I will keep the name here.
68

68
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:15,900
Now as a side note, we could have also passed our styles
69

69
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,160
from app component to goal item component via props.
70

70
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,440
We don't have to define the styles here
71

71
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,340
but it is a good practice to keep your styles
72

72
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,190
close to your JSX code.
73

73
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,010
And therefore I wanna move my styles
74

74
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:30,570
that belong to the goal item
75

75
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:34,810
from the app component into the goal item component as well.
76

76
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,370
And that would be these two objects
77

77
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:39,840
with their style properties.
78

78
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,690
I will cut them in app JS and move them over
79

79
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,930
to goal item JS.
80

80
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:49,450
And here in this object which we pass to the create method,
81

81
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:52,240
I'll paste in these two properties.
82

82
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,790
And with that, I can reference those properties
83

83
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,303
in my JSX code.
84

84
00:03:58,104 --> 00:03:59,610
So with that, we are creating this component.
85

85
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:02,200
We still need to take care about this text,
86

86
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,360
but we get our first component
87

87
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,490
and then app JS we can now import this component.
88

88
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,440
We can now also get rid of some imports
89

89
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,920
which we don't need anymore because I'm, for example,
90

90
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,470
not displaying a text component in there
91

91
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,450
and I'm not using scroll view anymore
92

92
00:04:18,998 --> 00:04:23,998
But I will now import goal item from components goal item.
93

93
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:30,536
And this works just as it works in our regular React app,
94

94
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:33,440
we import our components from other files like this,
95

95
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,200
we have a capital starting character
96

96
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,970
because we plan on using this in JSX
97

97
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,520
and we wanna make it clear to React
98

98
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,060
that this is a custom component.
99

99
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,673
Hence we start with a capital character.
100

100
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:47,610
Now down here in our JSX code,
101

101
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:52,610
where I return some markup inside of render item.
102

102
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,330
I now return my goal item component, so my own component.
103

103
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:01,050
And this is how we define and use a custom component.
104

104
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,560
And of course in the end it's totally the same
105

105
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:08,039
as we do it in a React for web project.
106

106
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:09,989
There isn't really any difference here.
