1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,370
So, that's it for this course section.
2

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,490
We learned a lot about React Native.
3

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,240
We built the first basic application here,
4

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,510
where we can add our course goals,
5

5
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,800
and whilst building this application,
6

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,410
we learned a lot about building user interfaces
7

7
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,253
with React Native, in general.
8

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,140
You learned that you must use these
9

9
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,940
built-in core components, for example.
10

10
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:31,100
You are not allowed to use HTML elements
11

11
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,820
like div's or anything like that.
12

12
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,760
Instead, you build the entire user interface
13

13
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,840
and all your custom components
14

14
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,893
from those built-in components.
15

15
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,150
But then you can combine them
16

16
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:47,053
as you need to, to build your own elements and features.
17

17
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:50,240
You also learned how styling works,
18

18
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,959
that you create such style sheet objects
19

19
00:00:52,959 --> 00:00:55,330
which hold nested objects,
20

20
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:56,490
which you can then assign
21

21
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,913
to different elements in your JSX code.
22

22
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:04,560
In those nested objects, we have CSS-like properties,
23

23
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,850
which allow us to set margins, paddings, colors,
24

24
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:10,490
and all these things.
25

25
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:13,170
Now even though it looks a bit like CSS,
26

26
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,083
or the names are similar, it isn't CSS.
27

27
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,170
We have no inheritance and in general,
28

28
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:22,950
it's just not CSS, it's JavaScript
29

29
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,670
and under the hood, React Native translates
30

30
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:29,750
our style settings to the Native style instructions
31

31
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,573
for the different platforms.
32

32
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,970
We, for example, saw that we had problems
33

33
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:38,380
assigning rounded corners to these elements on iOS,
34

34
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,940
whereas it worked without issues on Android
35

35
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,560
and therefore, its really important
36

36
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,507
to keep in mind that we have two different platforms
37

37
00:01:45,507 --> 00:01:48,220
and React Native just does its best
38

38
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,210
to talk to both platforms
39

39
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,653
and transform our instructions for them.
40

40
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,020
Now, what we also of course learned,
41

41
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,689
is that besides the components and the styling,
42

42
00:01:58,689 --> 00:02:02,620
we write regular React applications.
43

43
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:06,320
We can still use state, we can react to events,
44

44
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,300
those events are just not called onclick,
45

45
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,500
but instead onpress.
46

46
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,400
But then we can react to them, we can change state,
47

47
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,200
we can output state and we can do all these things
48

48
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,590
and this part, works exactly as you're used to.
49

49
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,520
There's nothing special about this.
50

50
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:27,520
React Native Plus React is exactly as React Web Plus React
51

51
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,403
when it comes to managing state and so on.
52

52
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,070
Now, we saw differences
53

53
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,263
when it came to outputting lists though.
54

54
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:38,210
We did this with a scroll view,
55

55
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:41,830
but then we switched to flat list for better performance.
56

56
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:45,140
Which is another built-in core component.
57

57
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,960
And you will see cases like this from time-to-time
58

58
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,100
throughout the course, where we have a special solution
59

59
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,220
for the Native platforms for better performance
60

60
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,603
or a Native look and feel.
61

61
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,980
But that's it for the basics for now.
62

62
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,360
In the end it's not too complex,
63

63
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,440
it's a React app, just with a different target platform,
64

64
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,320
but of course it is something you must get used to.
65

65
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,470
Working with those built-in components,
66

66
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,300
setting up styling like this.
67

67
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,370
It takes practice to get used to that.
68

68
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:19,350
And thankfully we'll have plenty of practice
69

69
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:20,360
throughout this course,
70

70
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,490
because this was just the first real section
71

71
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,310
and just the first app.
72

72
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,320
We're going to build way more
73

73
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,240
and we're going to learn way more
74

74
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,990
throughout the rest of this course.
