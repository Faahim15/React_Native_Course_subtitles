1
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:04,750
So now after this deep dive, let's use
2

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:08,700
our newly gained knowledge to improve this overall layout.
3

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,590
One thing I will do for example,
4

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,970
is work on this app container padding.
5

5
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:15,970
This actually doesn't use any of the new knowledge
6

6
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:19,103
but I need to do this to make this look a bit prettier.
7

7
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:24,340
I basically just want to have a padding to the top of 50
8

8
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,610
and then I wanna have a padding horizontal,
9

9
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,360
so left and right of 16.
10

10
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,363
So not of 50 but of 16.
11

11
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,910
With that I'd say, this generally looks better,
12

12
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:41,840
though we can see that this padding is kind of ignored
13

13
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,993
and our button here is going off the screen.
14

14
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,830
This can be fixed by decreasing the amount of width
15

15
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:55,150
our text input has to 70% maybe.
16

16
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,350
Now this looks better.
17

17
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:01,320
What doesn't look better though is where this text is
18

18
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,640
in this button.
19

19
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,480
This is something we can improve with align items
20

20
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,063
on the input container though.
21

21
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,110
At the moment, the problem is that basically this button
22

22
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:16,650
is stretched to be as high as this text input.
23

23
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,870
And the text is then not centered in the button
24

24
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,990
because the button doesn't have any styles
25

25
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:23,090
that would center the text.
26

26
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:25,650
Now you could think that maybe we can add some styling
27

27
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,780
to the button but it turned out that the button
28

28
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:32,530
is a component that doesn't have a style prop.
29

29
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,760
It might look like it has because I'm getting
30

30
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,930
some auto completion here but that's actually only some
31

31
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:41,800
auto completion I get here because I typed the word style
32

32
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,333
before in this code file.
33

33
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:47,570
The proper auto completion that tells me that a certain prop
34

34
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:51,380
is supported looks like this with this kind of icon
35

35
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,660
next to it.
36

36
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,780
So the button doesn't have a style prop
37

37
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,173
because indeed it doesn't support styling.
38

38
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:01,740
You can always check out the official docs and dive into
39

39
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,163
an element there to see which props it supports.
40

40
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,000
And for example, on the button, there is no style prop.
41

41
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,593
Whereas on the view, for example, you do find a style prop.
42

42
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,730
But that's just a side note, that's why we have to fix it
43

43
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:22,890
differently and we can fix it by not stretching this button.
44

44
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:25,690
That would be one way of achieving this.
45

45
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:28,980
So we can set a line items here on input container
46

46
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:33,183
and set this to center instead of stretch.
47

47
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:38,760
With that, the button is now centered and looks better.
48

48
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,700
We could also build our own button
49

49
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,850
but that is something you will learn later.
50

50
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,240
So now this looks better.
51

51
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:50,160
I also wanna change how much space this input area takes up
52

52
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,490
though and how much space the list of goals takes up.
53

53
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:56,350
To achieve this, I'll do a couple of things.
54

54
00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:00,690
For example, I wanna add some padding to the bottom
55

55
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:04,670
on this input container of let's say 24.
56

56
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:08,130
so that there is some space between the view that holds
57

57
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:11,330
the text input and the button and the view that will hold
58

58
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:12,663
the list of goals later.
59

59
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,143
You can see that spacing here now.
60

60
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,150
We also could add a little border here,
61

61
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,100
so we could add a border to the bottom
62

62
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:27,833
and give it a width by setting border bottom width of one.
63

63
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,890
And then adding a border to the bottom and giving it a color
64

64
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:35,323
of let's say, maybe this gray again.
65

65
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:39,030
But of course you can pick any color you want.
66

66
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:43,083
Now we got this border and below that to the list of goals.
67

67
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:47,010
But now I want to make sure that my text input area
68

68
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:52,010
takes up one fourth, so 1/4 of the overall available height.
69

69
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:56,380
And this can be done with the flex property
70

70
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,940
as you learned.
71

71
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:02,940
We can set this to one and then add a styling object
72

72
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,900
to this view that holds the list of goals
73

73
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,140
that takes up three quarters of the available space,
74

74
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:15,143
which can be achieved by adding flex three to this view.
75

75
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,460
So therefore I'll add another styling object
76

76
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:23,070
in my style sheet here and name it, the goals container.
77

77
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,393
And here I'll set flex three.
78

78
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:31,750
As you learned, all the flex values are added together
79

79
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,260
as long as the containers to which they are added
80

80
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:38,640
are siblings to each other and are part
81

81
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,830
of the same surrounding parent element which is the case
82

82
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,580
for these two views
83

83
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:47,250
and then the space is distributed accordingly.
84

84
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:51,300
So one plus three is four and therefore this takes
85

85
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,343
one fourth and this will take three quarters.
86

86
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:59,140
We just have to add this here, so I will add a style prop
87

87
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:03,643
to this view and set this equal to styles goals container.
88

88
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:07,760
With that, it will look horrible.
89

89
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,930
And the reason for this is that we also need to work
90

90
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,740
on the outer container now.
91

91
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,360
The container that holds these two containers
92

92
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,023
on which we just set the flex properties.
93

93
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:21,570
This outer container needs to take up the entire height
94

94
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:24,320
of the app so that the inner containers
95

95
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,223
can then distribute this space.
96

96
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,420
By default, without the flex property,
97

97
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:34,150
this container will only take as much space as it needs
98

98
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,710
and that's only defined by the space
99

99
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:39,470
the content in the container takes up.
100

100
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:42,640
But now that we're setting flex on those containers
101

101
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,550
in the container, this doesn't work anymore.
102

102
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:48,470
And to fix this, we need to force this container to take
103

103
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:52,890
all the available height and we do this by simply adding
104

104
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:57,670
flex one to the app container so that the outer container
105

105
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:00,920
takes all the height because it's the only container here.
106

106
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,580
So flex one will give it all the space
107

107
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,590
and then the inner containers can divide
108

108
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,053
that available space.
109

109
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:13,960
So by adding flex one to the app container and saving this,
110

110
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,370
this now looks better.
111

111
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:20,223
And now this is a quarter and that here are three quarters.
112

112
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,580
Now if I look at it like this,
113

113
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,910
this still doesn't look perfect so what we might wanna do
114

114
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:31,910
is actually give that list here 4/5 of the available space,
115

115
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,720
so that goals container will get four
116

116
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,963
and the input container stays at one.
117

117
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:40,890
And instead of setting a padding bottom,
118

118
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:45,623
I will set a margin bottom here on the input container.
119

119
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,310
And with that, that looks better.
120

120
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:54,310
We could maybe even go to flex five down there
121

121
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,760
and leave it like this.
122

122
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,950
Feel free to experiment with this
123

123
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,610
and choose your own values.
124

124
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:03,590
But this will work for me and this is now flex box in action
125

125
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,900
to achieve a first basic layout.
126

126
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,273
Of course, this is not the final layout we will have though.
