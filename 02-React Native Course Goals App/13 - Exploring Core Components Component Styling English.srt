1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,090
So, let's dive into React Native.
2

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:07,270
For this, I'm back in this project
3

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:10,500
we created in the first course section.
4

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,640
In case you did not create it there
5

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,710
or you did remove it thereafter,
6

6
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:15,890
just make sure you got
7

7
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:19,210
the development environment set up mentioned there,
8

8
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:20,690
and then you can download
9

9
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:23,490
the attached starting project.
10

10
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,690
Once you did that, you will get the same code
11

11
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:26,860
as I have it here.
12

12
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,540
Just make sure that you open your terminal
13

13
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:31,080
or command prompt.
14

14
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,830
Here, I'm using the one integrated in this code
15

15
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:36,210
and that you install all the dependencies
16

16
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,363
this project needs, by running npm install.
17

17
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,214
And once that completed, you can run npm start
18

18
00:00:43,214 --> 00:00:45,710
to this Expo process
19

19
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:48,000
that watches the code and builds the preview
20

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,130
and serves it on our emulators.
21

21
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:54,920
I'll then press a and i
22

22
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,580
to start and run this app
23

23
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,970
on my running Android and iPhone
24

24
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:01,330
emulators and simulators.
25

25
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:02,210
Here you go.
26

26
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:05,433
These are my two preview devices.
27

27
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,860
Now, and actually as we already got some code
28

28
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:12,370
on which we worked in the first course section already,
29

29
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:15,240
and what we have in here in the end
30

30
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,230
is a React component, a Functional React component.
31

31
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,840
And indeed, in this course,
32

32
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,850
we will only work with functional components
33

33
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,310
and React hooks.
34

34
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,490
We will not use class based components.
35

35
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,663
So this is a regular functional component.
36

36
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,870
We also got this Styles constant,
37

37
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:39,340
this SyleSheet object down there.
38

38
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:42,820
And I will come back to that in a couple of minutes.
39

39
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,310
At the top of this file, we got some imports
40

40
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,090
and we're importing one component
41

41
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,860
from an Expo related package.
42

42
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,900
And the other components, namely View and Text
43

43
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,810
as well as this SyleSheet object here,
44

44
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,143
from React Native.
45

45
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:02,690
And Text and View are two
46

46
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:05,810
of those built in components,
47

47
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:08,070
actually two of the most important
48

48
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,640
built in components,
49

49
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,150
React Native exposes to you,
50

50
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,463
to use in your JSX code.
51

51
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:20,340
Because in here, you can't use divs or h2 tags
52

52
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:22,410
or anything like this.
53

53
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:26,450
These are HTML elements, which work in the browser
54

54
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:28,840
when you have a DOM to work with,
55

55
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,270
but they won't work here on a Native device,
56

56
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:35,610
because Native devices are not browsers.
57

57
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,400
They don't have that DOM,
58

58
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,573
and they don't support those HTML elements.
59

59
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:45,630
Keep this slide from the first course section in mind,
60

60
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:49,890
that is how React Native translates different elements
61

61
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,450
into different Native elements
62

62
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:54,343
for Android and iOS.
63

63
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,080
And that's why these components are exposed
64

64
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,970
by React Native.
65

65
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:04,520
Now, if you visit the official React Native website,
66

66
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,750
then there, you will find various guides
67

67
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,810
which you can definitely take a look at
68

68
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:13,090
but you will also find the components tab
69

69
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,350
where you get a list of the components
70

70
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,223
provided by React Native.
71

71
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,890
And as you can tell,
72

72
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:23,660
we actually don't have that many components here
73

73
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,090
because it turns out
74

74
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:28,180
that with a couple of core components,
75

75
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,880
you can build any kind of user interface.
76

76
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,600
For example, we got a Button here
77

77
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,790
and Image and Text and View.
78

78
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:39,690
And especially View and Text and Text Input
79

79
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,920
are super important components
80

80
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,910
which you will use all the time.
81

81
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,590
And as you will learn from this course,
82

82
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:48,560
you can build very complex user interfaces
83

83
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,890
with those core components that you have here.
84

84
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:55,780
Now, React Native is all about working
85

85
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,170
with those core components that are built into it.
86

86
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:02,070
You build your overall app UI
87

87
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,800
and your custom components
88

88
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,400
that might make up that UI,
89

89
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,170
by simply combining those core components.
90

90
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:12,390
Because these core components, as you learned,
91

91
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:15,880
are translated into Native UI widgets,
92

92
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,230
Native UI elements for Android and iOS
93

93
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,930
by a React Native.
94

94
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,600
That's why we work with those core components
95

95
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,150
that are provided by React Native.
96

96
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:29,100
And we can combine them in our React Code,
97

97
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:33,390
in our JSX code, to build our own components
98

98
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:36,213
and ultimately our own user interface.
99

99
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:40,180
So in the end, we just compose our components
100

100
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,020
by combining those core opponents.
101

101
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,660
And if you think about it,
102

102
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:48,090
that's the same for React for the web.
103

103
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:51,750
HTML happens to have more elements.
104

104
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,290
There are h1, h2 elements, divs, article section,
105

105
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,840
there are many HTML elements.
106

106
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,100
But in the end, you also just combine
107

107
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:04,460
those HTML elements to build the web user interface.
108

108
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,563
It's the same here for Native apps.
109

109
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,610
So that's what we do with those components.
110

110
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,600
Of course, another important aspect
111

111
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,110
of building user interfaces in general
112

112
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:19,430
is that you wanna style those apps.
113

113
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:24,110
And when using React Native, there is no CSS.
114

114
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:26,460
You can't write CSS code,
115

115
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,400
because again, it's not a browser,
116

116
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,313
so the CSS language doesn't exist here.
117

117
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:35,810
Instead, you can, of course, still apply Styles,
118

118
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:38,290
but you do this either in line,
119

119
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:40,520
essentially by using props
120

120
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,970
on those core components that are provided
121

121
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:47,500
or with help of these SyleSheet objects
122

122
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,400
or this SyleSheet object
123

123
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,703
which you already saw in the code before.
124

124
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:56,250
You therefore. write your styling in JavaScript.
125

125
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,640
And hence, you have no extra styling language.
126

126
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:03,150
It's all JavaScript, but the React Native team
127

127
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:06,840
gives you a lot of JavaScript properties
128

128
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,300
which you can set and pass to those core elements,
129

129
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:14,060
which are similar to the CSS properties.
130

130
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,540
But it's only a subset
131

131
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:19,260
of the overall CSS property and feature set.
132

132
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,944
But in the end, as you will learn
133

133
00:06:20,944 --> 00:06:21,870
throughout this Course,
134

134
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:25,000
you get all the important CSS properties
135

135
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,940
and features that you need
136

136
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:30,363
to build powerful and beautiful user interfaces.
137

137
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,630
But back here in our component code,
138

138
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:36,280
we can see how these core components
139

139
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,260
that are provided by React Native
140

140
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,740
are combined to build a new component,
141

141
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:44,290
in this case, the only component, the app component,
142

142
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:47,210
and how we then get this StyleSheet object,
143

143
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:50,230
which is used to set various styles
144

144
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:52,970
which if you take a look at those properties,
145

145
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:56,350
look similar to what you know from CSS.
146

146
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:59,270
And then actually this Styles object is provided
147

147
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:03,220
to this View component through a style prop.
148

148
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,640
But we will take a closer look at styling
149

149
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,550
and at building our own components in general
150

150
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:11,000
throughout the next minutes and hours, of course.
151

151
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:15,850
Now, just one final note about this app component:
152

152
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:18,470
At the moment, this is our only component here.
153

153
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:21,910
And indeed the app component in the app JS file
154

154
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,920
has a special purpose.
155

155
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,160
This is the root component
156

156
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,930
that is rendered in your app.
157

157
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:31,580
Expo will automatically take this component,
158

158
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,830
export it in this app JS file,
159

159
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:36,370
and render this as the root component.
160

160
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:39,960
So, any other user interface elements and components
161

161
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,180
must go into this app component
162

162
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:46,570
or into children or descendants of this app component.
163

163
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:49,170
But again, that is also something we'll explore
164

164
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:50,663
in greater details soon.
