1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:04,350
Now of course we will need to pass some data
2

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,340
to goal item though, because we got the item data here
3

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,023
in the app component and we need it here.
4

4
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:16,660
And this is a problem solved With props.
5

5
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,130
Again, just as we do it in any react app
6

6
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:22,290
because we are building a regular react app here,
7

7
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:24,340
we have a regular react component
8

8
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,453
and we can use props therefore.
9

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,970
And we can expect and use any props we want,
10

10
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,990
because it's our component.
11

11
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,020
So here for example, we could expect
12

12
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,860
that on this props object, we get a text property,
13

13
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,930
or a value property whatever you want.
14

14
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:42,653
I will go with text here.
15

15
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:47,930
And now we just have to make sure that in the place where
16

16
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:51,730
we use this component, so in the app component here,
17

17
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:55,670
We pass this prop so that we set a text prop here,
18

18
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:58,840
on goal item in the app component.
19

19
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,120
And then here we have to pass in
20

20
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,120
item data dot item dot text.
21

21
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,980
Because again, text is the property that holds
22

22
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:12,580
the actual text and I wanna pass this text as a value
23

23
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:15,053
to the text prop in my goal item.
24

24
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:19,653
And with that if we save this and I reload everything,
25

25
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,560
if I go back and I learn React Native here, this crashes.
26

26
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:30,380
Because of this error, can't find variable view.
27

27
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,010
What's wrong here?
28

28
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:35,410
Well, what's wrong is that in the goal item component,
29

29
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:38,200
I'm using the view and the text components
30

30
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,260
but I'm not importing them.
31

31
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,300
And I showed this on purpose,
32

32
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,453
because this is important to understand.
33

33
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,650
If you are working with a react for the WAP,
34

34
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:52,230
you can use DVs and h2 elements just like this.
35

35
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,420
You don't need to import them.
36

36
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,400
That's different in React Native.
37

37
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,020
There, all these components are provided by react native,
38

38
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,370
and you have to import them in order to use them.
39

39
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,680
So besides importing the style sheet here,
40

40
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,340
we also have to import view and text,
41

41
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,543
because we are using these two components in this JSX code.
42

42
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,950
And once we import them, if we now reload our apps again,
43

43
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:20,550
you will see that now of course if I do learn React Native,
44

44
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,290
this works again.
45

45
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,830
And now it's looking the same way as before,
46

46
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:27,490
Because in the end we get the same UI as before,
47

47
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,240
but we're achieving this with help
48

48
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,453
of another custom component.
