1
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,860
So let's dive into React Native
2

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:08,680
and let's of course start with the basics.
3

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,450
In this course section,
4

4
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:14,880
we are going to explore the core React Native concepts.
5

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,310
This means that we'll dive
6

6
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:18,810
into the core React Native Components,
7

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,930
and we will start building user interfaces
8

8
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,230
with those Components,
9

9
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:26,010
but we will of course also dive
10

10
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,170
into styling React Native apps.
11

11
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:31,720
We will learn how we can style those apps
12

12
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,030
and those Components,
13

13
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,000
such that we can really build the user interface
14

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,943
we wanna build.
15

15
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:41,030
And last but definitely not least,
16

16
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:45,070
we will explore how we can add interactivity to our app
17

17
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:46,780
and how we can manage state,
18

18
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,060
how we can make sure that there,
19

19
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,990
for example are buttons that can be clicked
20

20
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,890
and that something meaningful happens
21

21
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,393
when a button is clicked.
22

22
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,850
Now for this, in this course section,
23

23
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:04,770
we are going to build this demo app here.
24

24
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:07,870
It's a first simple React Native app
25

25
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:10,530
which allows you to track your goals.
26

26
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,310
For example, your goals for this course,
27

27
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:15,880
what you wanna achieve by taking this course
28

28
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,700
or as you are taking this course.
29

29
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,100
In this app, we got a list of goals
30

30
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,730
and we can open a model
31

31
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:25,930
and overly to add new goals.
32

32
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:28,120
And once a goal was added,
33

33
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,680
we can also tap the goal to remove it again.
34

34
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,100
This is maybe not the next billion dollar app
35

35
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,110
but it's a great first app
36

36
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:40,930
to learn about many core fundamentals you must know
37

37
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:42,363
about React Native.
