1
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:03,410
So to close the modal,
2

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:06,370
whenever we click add goal or cancel,
3

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:10,140
we have to react to taps on those buttons.
4

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,460
And then in the end,
5

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,630
we have to change the visibility state in the app component
6

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,520
because modal is visible in the end controls
7

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,480
whether the modal is shown or not.
8

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,320
Now we already got a 'StartAddGoalHandler'
9

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,280
which opens the modal.
10

10
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:31,250
Now we can add a 'EndAddGoalHandler'
11

11
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:35,693
which should set 'ModalIsVisible' to false.
12

12
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,280
And now we just need to make sure this function
13

13
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,940
gets called whenever a user taps
14

14
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,893
on the 'Add Goal' or 'Cancel' buttons.
15

15
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,120
Now, if a user taps on 'Add Goal',
16

16
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,200
the 'AddGoalHandler' is triggered
17

17
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,320
which triggers the function received on the 'onAddGoal' prop
18

18
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:57,703
which turns out to be this function.
19

19
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:01,950
So in order to close the modal if a goal was added,
20

20
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:06,950
we just have to set 'ModalIsVisible' to false here as well
21

21
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:12,250
or call the 'endAddGoalHandler' manually here.
22

22
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,200
Both would work.
23

23
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,590
Now to also close it,
24

24
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,060
If we tap the cancel button,
25

25
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,840
in goal input we have to add 'onPress'
26

26
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,080
to this button as well,
27

27
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,690
And then expect that we get a pointer
28

28
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:30,270
to this 'endAddGoalHandler'
29

29
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,513
passed into 'GoalInput' through props.
30

30
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:35,810
So here we could expect
31

31
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:40,200
that we get a function on a cancel prop.
32

32
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,913
It's our component, so the prop name is up to you.
33

33
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:47,100
Now we just have to make sure that this prop is provided
34

34
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,890
in app component.
35

35
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:52,220
Here we pass the 'onCancel' prop
36

36
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,340
to the 'GoalInput' component
37

37
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:58,563
and point at the end, 'addGoalHandler' function,
38

38
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:01,890
so that this function is executed
39

39
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,660
whenever the cancel button is clicked, or pressed.
40

40
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,060
With that, if we save this.
41

41
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,873
Indeed, if I click cancel the modal closes.
42

42
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,465
And if I add a goal here,
43

43
00:02:14,465 --> 00:02:16,450
like this, and I click add goal,
44

44
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:18,940
it also closes, but the goal is there.
45

45
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:22,133
And of course it also works on Android.
46

46
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,583
Both adding and removing, and opening and closing.
