1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:04,790
Now to finally finish this app here.
2

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:07,590
I wanna improve the overall look and feel,
3

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:11,060
by changing some colors and by adding an image.
4

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,480
Which is something we haven't done yet.
5

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,710
But which is of course, something you will often do.
6

6
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:17,710
And you should therefore know how to do.
7

7
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:21,170
Now, adding an image, thankfully is easy.
8

8
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:23,603
Because React Native has a component for it.
9

9
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,120
There is an "image" component,
10

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,533
which you can import from React Native.
11

11
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,840
And just as you have,
12

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,590
the "image" element for the web, in HTML.
13

13
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:39,263
This is a component that helps with displaying an image.
14

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,420
This "image" component is used in your JSX Code.
15

15
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:45,410
And here I wanna display an image,
16

16
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:47,083
right above the text input.
17

17
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,023
So, I will add my image here.
18

18
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,210
On this image, you can then add some style.
19

19
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,770
Which we'll do in a second.
20

20
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,523
But most importantly, you can also add a "source" prop.
21

21
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:03,310
And this should point at the image you want to add.
22

22
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:05,200
Now, when it comes to that image,
23

23
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,223
you do find an example image attached.
24

24
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,550
And you should download that image
25

25
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:14,370
and move it into your "assets" folder.
26

26
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:17,760
Or to be precise create an "images" folder
27

27
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,840
in that "assets" folder.
28

28
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,040
Because that "assets" folder is generally,
29

29
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,760
the folder where static assets like images should be stored.
30

30
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,060
And then move that attached image,
31

31
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:32,420
into that "images" folder in the "assets" folder.
32

32
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:35,563
And it's this "goal image", which you got attached.
33

33
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:40,410
And now when it comes to linking to that image.
34

34
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:44,340
It works differently than what you're used to from the web.
35

35
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,987
We won't create some link here, which points to
36

36
00:01:48,987 --> 00:01:52,750
"assets/images/goal.png"
37

37
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,090
at least not quite.
38

38
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:58,600
It's not too wrong, but it wouldn't work like this.
39

39
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,480
If I save this, you see, I get a warning.
40

40
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,333
I get an error, this doesn't work.
41

41
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,620
Instead, you have to import the image here
42

42
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:11,003
with a special import syntax.
43

43
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,930
You should use a "require" function.
44

44
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:17,150
Which you might know from Node.js,
45

45
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,363
if you worked with that.
46

46
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,130
And to that "require" function,
47

47
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:24,020
you pass the path to the image.
48

48
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:28,290
However, the path is a relative path from the file
49

49
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:30,590
in which you're using this "require" function.
50

50
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:34,820
So, seen relatively from that goal input file,
51

51
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,230
which is that file,
52

52
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:38,580
where this "required" function gets used.
53

53
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,800
We have to go up one level,
54

54
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,763
to leave the "components" folder.
55

55
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,533
And then dive into images and select the image.
56

56
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:51,762
Now to go up one level we type ../,
57

57
00:02:51,762 --> 00:02:53,863
this means go to the parent folder.
58

58
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:59,090
And then we dive into assets, images, goal.png.
59

59
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,763
This is how we add an image.
60

60
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,450
Now let's also add some styling to it.
61

61
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,840
And for this, I'll add an "image styling" object
62

62
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,980
in my style sheet here.
63

63
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:13,500
And here we could set a width of let's say 100 pixels.
64

64
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,033
And a height of 100 pixels.
65

65
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:20,450
And give this a margin of 20 in all directions,
66

66
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,820
to have some spacing around the image.
67

67
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,540
As always, you can play around with
68

68
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,113
the styling, to find your favorite styles.
69

69
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,950
Now I wanna apply that style to my image.
70

70
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,380
And thankfully the "image" element,
71

71
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:37,670
the "image" Component, does support the style prop.
72

72
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:40,040
And we can set "styles.image",
73

73
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,073
as a value on that style prop.
74

74
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:47,360
And with that, if we reload the app by pressing R here
75

75
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,790
in the terminal.
76

76
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:51,810
You will see nothing.
77

77
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,440
As it seems.
78

78
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,110
The reason for that is that the image is white.
79

79
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,490
And we can't see that,
80

80
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:59,950
because the background is also white.
81

81
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,350
That's no problem because,
82

82
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:04,120
I wanted to changed the background as well.
83

83
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,810
And since we're in the modal here.
84

84
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:07,880
This background can be changed.
85

85
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,090
By setting a different background on this input container.
86

86
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,760
Because that is our root element in the modal.
87

87
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,313
And it defines the overall modal container look therefore.
88

88
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,140
The modal itself does support the style prop.
89

89
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:24,080
But for styling the overall modal background,
90

90
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,483
you should use a nested view, as we are doing it here.
91

91
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:31,960
And now here on this input container.
92

92
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,863
We can add a background color.
93

93
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,960
And I prepared a nice dark purple,
94

94
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,410
which I'd like to use here.
95

95
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:45,513
Which has to hex code 311b6b.
96

96
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:47,860
And whilst we're here,
97

97
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,680
I also wanna change some other styles.
98

98
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,500
For example, we don't need the border
99

99
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,850
at the bottom anymore.
100

100
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:55,180
Because there is nothing below that.
101

101
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:58,670
And that border here looks really strange.
102

102
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,910
So I will remove that border.
103

103
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:05,910
And I will also remove that margin to the bottom
104

104
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:07,543
which I have here.
105

105
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,400
So that these are the remaining styles that I have here.
106

106
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,410
And with this, now we can see the image.
107

107
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:17,483
Because now we got this nice purple background.
108

108
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:20,260
Only in the modal though.
109

109
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,720
We will work on the other background later.
110

110
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,270
But here in the model, we got that.
111

111
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:28,090
Of course, we now also might want to,
112

112
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:30,570
tweak the text color here.
113

113
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:33,280
When we enter something into this input field.
114

114
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,790
And we might wanna tweak the buttons here as well.
115

115
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:39,110
To make those look a bit prettier as well.
116

116
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:42,330
Because currently they don't fit the background.
117

117
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:45,240
But most importantly, we did now add the image.
118

118
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,660
Which was the main task for this lecture.
119

119
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:50,800
And as you saw, adding an image is super simple.
120

120
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,903
With that "image" Component and this way of adding a source.
121

121
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:58,340
So let's next improve the overall styling
122

122
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,230
of those modal elements.
123

123
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,363
The other elements, I mean.
