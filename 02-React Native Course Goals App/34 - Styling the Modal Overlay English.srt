1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:03,290
So to work on the styling here.
2

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:06,580
In the end we need to go into the GoalInput component.
3

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:08,590
There, we have this model
4

4
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:11,200
and in the model we have this View.
5

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,370
Which in the end is responsible for controlling how
6

6
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,173
the textInput and button are displayed.
7

7
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,290
Now I wanna change the overall look.
8

8
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:22,990
I now wanna have the button beneath the textInput
9

9
00:00:23,942 --> 00:00:25,330
and I wanna have another button
10

10
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,160
in addition to add goal.
11

11
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,470
Because that other button should allow us
12

12
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:30,963
to close that model.
13

13
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,890
Now to achieve this I will restructure this a bit.
14

14
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:40,630
And I will actually add another View in here,
15

15
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:44,223
below the textInput, and move my button into this View.
16

16
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,090
And add another button here
17

17
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,060
with a title of Cancel.
18

18
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:56,890
So that I can add the goal or cancel adding.
19

19
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,340
And this should in the future close my model.
20

20
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,860
at the moment it won't do anything though.
21

21
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,350
Now with that, we got that View in a View.
22

22
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:07,070
But now I wanna change the styles of that outer View,
23

23
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,170
which is the main View inside the model.
24

24
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:12,000
Because it's the first element in the model.
25

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,980
The top most element in the model.
26

26
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:18,780
And on this input container, I wanna use flex 1.
27

27
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,530
So that it takes all the available space in the model.
28

28
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,963
But I wanna change the flexDirection back to column.
29

29
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,870
And therefore we can also remove it
30

30
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,823
because that is the default anyways.
31

31
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,690
With this, if I save this,
32

32
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:37,083
the buttons are now below the textInput.
33

33
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,660
But they are totally stretched out,
34

34
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:44,030
because we have space between for justifyContent.
35

35
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:46,470
This should instead be center
36

36
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,800
to make sure all the content is centered.
37

37
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,120
This now looks way better.
38

38
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,970
Now in addition these two buttons
39

39
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,470
should be next to each other
40

40
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:00,090
and therefore I added this View around the buttons.
41

41
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,960
and I will give this View some styling.
42

42
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,290
So here, maybe at the bottom,
43

43
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:08,560
I'll add my buttonContainer object.
44

44
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,670
And actually give this a flexDirection of row.
45

45
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:16,130
So that the two buttons are next to each other.
46

46
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:19,930
And then add this buttonContainer on this View.
47

47
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,860
So here I'll add a style
48

48
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,460
which is styles.buttonContainer.
49

49
00:02:25,531 --> 00:02:30,130
And with that, the buttons do sit next to each other.
50

50
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:33,400
Now it would be nice if the buttons had
51

51
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,560
maybe a fixed width and some spacing between them.
52

52
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,230
And to achieve this, since I can't style these buttons,
53

53
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,400
since they're built in
54

54
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,380
and since I don't wanna build my own button
55

55
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,433
which we could do but which is some extra work.
56

56
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:51,380
I'll actually wrap each button into a View as well.
57

57
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,470
Because then I can style that View instead of the button.
58

58
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:58,920
And therefore still influence the look of the button a bit.
59

59
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,920
So here I'll assign a style property to those Views here.
60

60
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:08,050
And setup a dedicated styling object for those buttons.
61

61
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:10,220
I'll name style object button.
62

62
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,400
And for every button here I'll just make sure
63

63
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,400
that it takes, lets say, 40% of the available width.
64

64
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:22,090
And then we might want to add a marginHorizontal,
65

65
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:25,340
So margin left and right, of eight pixels.
66

66
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,790
So that we have some spacing between the buttons.
67

67
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,660
And it's now this button style here
68

68
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:35,560
which I wanna add to the Views that hold the buttons.
69

69
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,040
And that's a quick and easy way
70

70
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,270
of setting my own styles to the buttons
71

71
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:42,600
even though I can't change the button style itself.
72

72
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,590
But you can change the width or height with that,
73

73
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:49,270
you can add margins between them.
74

74
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,120
You wouldn't be able to change the color
75

75
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,930
or text color though, if that was your plan
76

76
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,800
you would have to build your own button.
77

77
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,790
And in general, if you need more adjustments,
78

78
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:00,470
you might wanna build your own button
79

79
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,930
by using the pressable component.
80

80
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,460
But this is good enough for now
81

81
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,710
and it gives me these equal sized buttons
82

82
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:07,713
below the textInput.
83

83
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,750
I also wanna have some spacing between
84

84
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,900
the textInputs and the buttons.
85

85
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,430
And maybe we can shrink them a little bit.
86

86
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,720
So to shrink them I'll change the width to 30% here
87

87
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:23,460
or we set this to a fixed pixel width of 100 for example,
88

88
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,850
like this.
89

89
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:28,120
And for the spacing between the textInput and the buttons.
90

90
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,610
On the buttonContainer I will add a marginTop
91

91
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:36,660
of let's say, 8 or maybe 16.
92

92
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,090
So now I save this there is some distance
93

93
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:42,503
between the buttons and the textInput above the buttons.
94

94
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:47,250
The textInput now also can become wider.
95

95
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,787
So I will set the width of the textInput to 100%.
96

96
00:04:52,766 --> 00:04:55,250
And with that, I reloaded the app in between
97

97
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:58,030
so I will reopen this, this is now wider.
98

98
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:01,080
Now it would still be nice to have some area
99

99
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,350
around that which is not occupied.
100

100
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,300
And therefore on the overall container,
101

101
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,560
Which is that root View in that model,
102

102
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,430
I will add a little of padding in all directions
103

103
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:13,690
and let's say add 16 pixels of padding.
104

104
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:16,830
And now I'd say this doesn't look too bad.
105

105
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:17,750
Last but not least
106

106
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,860
we still have some extra spacing to the right
107

107
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,430
of the textInput,
108

108
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,170
because we had a margin to right
109

109
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,970
and I wanna get rid of that as well.
110

110
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,690
So now this does look quite good.
111

111
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:29,820
And of course you can adjust this a bit further
112

112
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,410
if you want to.
113

113
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,880
Now I wanna make sure the model closes
114

114
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,310
whenever we cancel or click add goal though.
115

115
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,773
Because at the moment that's not happening.
