1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:03,570
So back in our code,
2

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,750
this means that we can use flex box on this view,
3

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,460
which is the container of text input and button,
4

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,433
to control how these two elements are positioned,
5

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,060
because you learned flex box is a concept
6

6
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:18,620
that is applied to container elements
7

7
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,400
to control how much space the container takes up.
8

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,320
That's something we'll do in a second.
9

9
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,340
And then how the elements inside
10

10
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,110
of the container are positioned.
11

11
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,743
That is what we'll do right now.
12

12
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:34,630
For this, I'll add a number, style property here
13

13
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:36,610
in my style sheet object,
14

14
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:39,993
and I will name it Input Container.
15

15
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,460
Now on this element, we can now set flex direction to row,
16

16
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,740
and then we can apply this input container styling
17

17
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,780
to this view.
18

18
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,970
So here we add the style prop,
19

19
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:57,853
and then refer to styles dot input container.
20

20
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,830
If we save that,
21

21
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:05,300
you will see the button is now next to the input element.
22

22
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,730
So this already utilizes flex box because by default
23

23
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:11,620
flex box is enabled on all those views.
24

24
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:15,003
You can start using those flex properties right away.
25

25
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,053
The default setting was that flex direction was column,
26

26
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,770
which is why the elements were beneath each other.
27

27
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:26,330
But if we switched to row, as I just did,
28

28
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,580
they sit next to each other in the same row,
29

29
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,233
which hopefully makes sense.
30

30
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,490
Now we might want to control how they are laid out,
31

31
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:35,410
and for this,
32

32
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:38,390
we can add another property to the input container,
33

33
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:42,070
and that is the justify content property.
34

34
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:45,050
You will learn more about all these flex box properties
35

35
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:46,940
in depth in the next lecture,
36

36
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,820
but justify content basically controls
37

37
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:54,190
how these elements are distributed in the row or column
38

38
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:57,623
depending on what the value here is that they are part of.
39

39
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,550
So here, for example,
40

40
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:02,890
space between is one of the allowed values,
41

41
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,450
and as you set this to space between,
42

42
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:08,453
you see there now is more space between these elements.
43

43
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:12,483
Now we can also still control the width of those elements.
44

44
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:18,670
For example, here, we could add a text input style object
45

45
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,900
in our style sheet object,
46

46
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,430
and I will add this to the text input here.
47

47
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:29,430
And here I then wanna add a border with a width of one
48

48
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:34,720
and a border color of CCCCCC, which is a light gray.
49

49
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:39,010
By the way, I get a color picker here
50

50
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:41,740
because of an extra extension, which I installed.
51

51
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,433
You don't need that though.
52

52
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,900
And now, in addition,
53

53
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:51,900
I will give this text input a width of, let's say, 80%.
54

54
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,670
And this is all the new.
55

55
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:59,070
Now in most places where you can set a size as pixels,
56

56
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:02,900
so as numbers, you can also set sizes in percentage,
57

57
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,500
though you need to wrap that in quotes
58

58
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,290
so you set a string in the end.
59

59
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,170
But then you add the percentage sign
60

60
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:14,790
and your percentage number to set a certain percentage.
61

61
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,410
And with this, I'm saying that I want this element,
62

62
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:18,810
which has this style,
63

63
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:23,040
to take up 80% off the available width.
64

64
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,800
The available width will be defined by the container
65

65
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,100
in which the element sits,
66

66
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,940
but then the element which receives this style
67

67
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:34,223
will take 80% of that container's width.
68

68
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,540
So therefore, now I want to add this text input style here
69

69
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:41,090
on this text input element,
70

70
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,530
and we do this by adding the style prop
71

71
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,683
and then its styles, text input.
72

72
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,090
If we do this and save that,
73

73
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:53,723
now we got this border, and this looks like 80% width.
74

74
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,960
Maybe we also want a little bit of margin to the right
75

75
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,660
so that there is some spacing here.
76

76
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:04,800
There is no spacing right now, despite having space between,
77

77
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,600
because this takes 80% of the width
78

78
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,410
and the button automatically takes the rest.
79

79
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,360
And therefore to add some spacing here,
80

80
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:16,930
we'll add a margin to the right on the text input
81

81
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,053
of, let's say, eight pixels.
82

82
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,583
With that, there is some spacing again.
83

83
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,960
We could also add a little bit of padding maybe
84

84
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,140
so that the text isn't directly on the edge.
85

85
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:34,020
So, therefore, I'll also add padding eight here
86

86
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,963
on the text input object.
87

87
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,470
So with that, we get some padding as well.
88

88
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:45,220
Now that's it for this basic introduction to flex box.
89

89
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,750
This is an not all we'll do.
90

90
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,390
This is not the finished layout.
91

91
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:51,140
I do see that the spacing is a bit off here
92

92
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,380
on the right and the left.
93

93
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,890
I do see that the button doesn't look that great
94

94
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:56,330
here on Android.
95

95
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,660
And we will work on this,
96

96
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,710
but first let's dive a little bit deeper into flex box
97

97
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:04,170
and the different things we can do with it
98

98
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,603
before we then continue working on this app.
