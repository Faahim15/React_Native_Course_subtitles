1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,600
So for improving the overall look and feel here,
2

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,883
I wanna start by changing the button colors.
3

3
00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:11,100
For this, we can go to our JSX code
4

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,380
because you learned that for these built in buttons,
5

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,048
you change the colors with the color prop.
6

6
00:00:16,048 --> 00:00:18,100
And again, I prepared some hex codes,
7

7
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,770
which I think look quite nice.
8

8
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:24,750
And for adding an item here,
9

9
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,123
I wanna use the code 5E0acc.
10

10
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:32,840
And for canceling, I prepared another code,
11

11
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,803
which is F31282.
12

12
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:41,380
If we save this, this is how the buttons look like.
13

13
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:44,310
And it looks good on Android, but on iOS,
14

14
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,890
it's a bit hard to read I would say.
15

15
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,119
This is a bit hard to read.
16

16
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:51,623
So actually, we might wanna tweak this
17

17
00:00:51,623 --> 00:00:56,130
and pick a slightly lighter purple,
18

18
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:59,393
like B180f0,
19

19
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:04,050
which I think looks good on iOS as well.
20

20
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:06,500
It doesn't look as good on Android,
21

21
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,340
but for the moment I don't wanna dive
22

22
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,690
into writing different code for different platforms.
23

23
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:14,300
We will do that later in the course,
24

24
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:18,230
but for now let's stick to this uniform solution here,
25

25
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:21,670
where we have the same code for both platforms.
26

26
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:23,660
Of course, feel free to optimize the app
27

27
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,360
for one of the two platforms.
28

28
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,490
For example, if you're on windows and you can't test this
29

29
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:31,756
on iOS anyways, you can of course choose a prettier color
30

30
00:01:31,756 --> 00:01:33,333
for this button there.
31

31
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:35,830
But we got these buttons now,
32

32
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:38,840
let's now work on the text input styling.
33

33
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,840
And for this, we got this text input styling object here.
34

34
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:47,730
In there, I wanna to change the border color a little bit
35

35
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:50,873
and choose E4d0ff.
36

36
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,460
And also give this a background color
37

37
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,450
which should be the same color.
38

38
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,983
So I'll just copy that as a background for the text input.
39

39
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,800
I will now also change the color of the text that's entered
40

40
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,040
to 120438,
41

41
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,443
which is another prepared hex code.
42

42
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:13,022
Since I added a border,
43

43
00:02:13,022 --> 00:02:15,864
I also wanna change the border radius,
44

44
00:02:15,864 --> 00:02:20,770
so that I have some rounded corners with border radius
45

45
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:22,703
and set this to six pixels.
46

46
00:02:24,142 --> 00:02:27,240
And with that, that is how this input looks like.
47

47
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,193
And I think that doesn't look too bad.
48

48
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:32,310
Last but not least, I will ramp up the padding
49

49
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,733
a little bit though, and change it to 16,
50

50
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,520
so that we got this padding here.
51

51
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,310
So that's now how this model looks like.
52

52
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:44,520
And I would say it doesn't look too bad.
53

53
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,883
We can now learn React Native and this app looks quite nice.
54

54
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,300
I just wanna switch to button order
55

55
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,390
because I ended a bit more intuitive
56

56
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,910
if the add button is on the right,
57

57
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,120
but of course, this comes down to personal preference
58

58
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,440
and is totally up to you.
59

59
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,270
But now, this works.
60

60
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,610
Last but not least,
61

61
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:09,830
I also wanna improve the styling of this main screen though.
62

62
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,870
Because I think that white background color
63

63
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,080
isn't too pretty.
64

64
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,542
Here, I prepared a little color for us.
65

65
00:03:16,542 --> 00:03:20,403
And it has the hex code 1e085a.
66

66
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,440
Now, if we set it like this, this works
67

67
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,400
and we got this as a background color.
68

68
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,570
And this works just fine here.
69

69
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:30,520
But if we had multiple screens in this app,
70

70
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,680
so not just the model, but also other screens,
71

71
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,770
which we will have later once we add navigation,
72

72
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:39,750
then manually setting the background color like this
73

73
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,063
all the time, can become annoying.
74

74
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:46,930
Therefore what you can do when using expo,
75

75
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:49,530
is you can go to the app.json file.
76

76
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:53,020
And in that file, you can actually also add
77

77
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:57,970
a special background color configuration item
78

78
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:00,028
and set this to a hex code.
79

79
00:04:00,028 --> 00:04:03,230
And this will then automatically be applied
80

80
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:07,082
as a background color to all screens by expo.
81

81
00:04:07,082 --> 00:04:10,620
So if I now reload after adding this to app.json
82

82
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,580
and saving that file, we also got this background color,
83

83
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:18,079
but now it's applied by expo to all the main screens,
84

84
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,060
not to the model, but to all the main screens
85

85
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,442
that are not overlays.
86

86
00:04:23,442 --> 00:04:26,640
Here, we only have one screen, so it didn't matter.
87

87
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,950
But this can be the more convenient approach
88

88
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,970
if you do have multiple screens.
89

89
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:35,030
Of course, like this, I'm not totally happy
90

90
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:38,180
with the way this add new goal button looks.
91

91
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:41,139
I think it's a bit hard to see on iOS.
92

92
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:44,350
Therefore, what I will do is in App.js,
93

93
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,616
I will change the color of this button.
94

94
00:04:46,616 --> 00:04:51,616
And we could go for a lighter purple like this.
95

95
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:55,000
And I think that looks a bit nicer.
96

96
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,770
So now with the styling changed,
97

97
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:00,260
there's one thing that might become obvious.
98

98
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,920
The status bar is really difficult to see
99

99
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,093
on both these devices.
100

100
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,390
The reason for that is that it's still black,
101

101
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:11,970
that it doesn't know that we have a dark background.
102

102
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:15,947
Now, thankfully, expo gives us a solution for that.
103

103
00:05:15,947 --> 00:05:20,947
We can import a special component from expo.
104

104
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:24,613
And that component is the status bar.
105

105
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,780
We can import it from expo-status-bar,
106

106
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,530
which is a standalone package
107

107
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,360
which is already part of this project.
108

108
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,670
This package here.
109

109
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:39,830
This is a component which we can use to fine tune
110

110
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,893
the look of the status bar.
111

111
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:46,523
We simply use this status bar as a component,
112

112
00:05:46,523 --> 00:05:50,820
here in our JSX code, in this root app component.
113

113
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,000
So here we can add StatusBar.
114

114
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,810
And since it's now next to another sibling component,
115

115
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:58,760
right at the top of the return to JSX code,
116

116
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,700
I will wrap it with such a fragment,
117

117
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:05,070
since you're not allowed to have sibling elements
118

118
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:07,823
at the root level of JSX code otherwise.
119

119
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,690
So we add this wrapping fragment
120

120
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:12,620
and add the StatusBar component
121

121
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,083
next to our root view component.
122

122
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,760
And on this StatusBar component,
123

123
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,640
you can now set a style prop, which one's a string though?
124

124
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,756
And you can now set the status bar to dark or light
125

125
00:06:25,756 --> 00:06:28,713
or let it infer it automatically.
126

126
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:32,230
Now, auto doesn't work here.
127

127
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:35,384
So I will set it to light.
128

128
00:06:35,384 --> 00:06:38,880
And if I do that, the status bar becomes white
129

129
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,900
and is now way easier to see again.
130

130
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,860
And that is definitely a tweak we also wanna apply
131

131
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,620
so that we do have an app that looks good
132

132
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,751
and that still allows the user to see
133

133
00:06:49,751 --> 00:06:53,853
crucial phone information like the battery or the time.
134

134
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,450
But with that, this app is finished now.
135

135
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:00,170
Definitely feel free to dive deeper into it
136

136
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:03,170
and tweak it and play around with styles,
137

137
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:06,366
position things differently, add features,
138

138
00:07:06,366 --> 00:07:08,400
but for now we're done.
139

139
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,810
We are of course, going to dive way deeper into React Native
140

140
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:13,683
in the next course sections though.
