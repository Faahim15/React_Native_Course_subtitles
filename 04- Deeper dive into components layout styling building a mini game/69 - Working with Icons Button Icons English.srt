1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,460
So now we're making good progress here.
2

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,890
We worked on these buttons, but I'm not done yet.
3

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,670
There are two main things I wanna change
4

4
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:13,540
before we move on to the Game Over screen.
5

5
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:16,390
And the first thing which I'd like to change
6

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:20,240
is the icons in the buttons.
7

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,480
At the moment we have regular characters in there,
8

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,200
a minus and a plus, and I would like to use proper icons,
9

9
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,230
which are a bit prettier.
10

10
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:32,760
In addition, I also want to use custom fonts,
11

11
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:36,690
so that I'm not stuck with these default device fonts,
12

12
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,810
which are okay but which I don't wanna use here,
13

13
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,740
but that I instead can use my own custom fonts,
14

14
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:45,500
because of course, that is also a typical requirement
15

15
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,440
that you wanna bring your own fonts.
16

16
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,920
Now let's start with the icons though.
17

17
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,330
Thankfully, when working with Expo,
18

18
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,640
adding icons is super simple
19

19
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,740
because Expo and Expo-created projects
20

20
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:02,420
already come with a library, a package,
21

21
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:05,290
that allows us to use icons.
22

22
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:08,730
We just have to add a import here at the top
23

23
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:13,730
and we import something from @expo/vector-icons.
24

24
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:19,210
Now this should be available automatically
25

25
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:22,460
out of the box without you installing anything
26

26
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:25,763
because it is a peer dependency of Expo.
27

27
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:31,830
And from this package, you can import various icon sets.
28

28
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,740
Now, if you search for Expo vector icons,
29

29
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,970
you should find the official icons documentation.
30

30
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:40,320
And there, you can learn more about this library
31

31
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,560
and that it is installed by default
32

32
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,090
if you created your project with Expo in it,
33

33
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,480
and how you can use it
34

34
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,760
and which kind of icon sets you can use,
35

35
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,163
you can learn more here.
36

36
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,860
Now, one icon set that's built in which I like a lot
37

37
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,393
are the Ionicons.
38

38
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,170
Actually, there are more icon sets available
39

39
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,100
which provide different kinds of icons,
40

40
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,530
but Ionicons is one of them, which I like a lot.
41

41
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:09,670
Now on the official docs about Expo vector icons,
42

42
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:13,290
you can find a list of the built-in icons.
43

43
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,000
And for example, there if you search for minus,
44

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,820
you find various minuses,
45

45
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,650
belonging to different icon sets,
46

46
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:24,290
which are included with Expo vector icons.
47

47
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,990
And you do, for example,
48

48
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:30,240
also find the Ionicons minus in there.
49

49
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,800
For this, I'll add a little filter here
50

50
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,943
to filter only for Ionicons,
51

51
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,480
and actually search for remove.
52

52
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,970
And then here you find various icons
53

53
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,610
and I will use this md-remove icon, which is this minus.
54

54
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:48,270
But you can of course use any icon you want.
55

55
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,740
This name is important,
56

56
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:53,200
because you use these icons by grabbing this icon set
57

57
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,090
which is imported from Expo vector icons.
58

58
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:00,060
And then in the place where you wanna use an icon,
59

59
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:03,763
you render this as a component, as a self-closing component,
60

60
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,250
which gets a name prompt.
61

61
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,670
And now the name is that icon you want to use.
62

62
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,680
And we even get auto-completion here.
63

63
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,350
And we, for example, get help and learn that md-remove
64

64
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:17,043
is indeed a valid icon we can use here.
65

65
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,360
Now you can, in addition, also add a size prompt,
66

66
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,170
which sets the size in pixels.
67

67
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,763
And here I'll set this to 24 to have a nice big icon.
68

68
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,730
And you can set the color, and here I'll set this to white,
69

69
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:33,653
but you could also add a hex code or anything like this.
70

70
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:39,314
And with that, now we have this nice minus here.
71

71
00:03:39,314 --> 00:03:41,720
And we can do the same thing for the plus.
72

72
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,510
We replace the plus character with Ionicons.
73

73
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:49,320
And now instead of md-remove, it's indeed md-add.
74

74
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,110
Same size, same color.
75

75
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:55,470
And with that added, we now also have this plus here.
76

76
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:58,020
And I'm using the same icons on both platforms.
77

77
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:01,300
You could even use different icons on different platforms,
78

78
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,200
but we will learn more about platform specific code
79

79
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,223
in the next course section.
