1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:05,450
Now, that is it for this game.
2

2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:08,530
You can absolutely fine tune this game
3

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:10,270
a bit more if you want to.
4

4
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:12,380
You can change the styling, the layout,
5

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,613
and you absolutely should play around
6

6
00:00:14,613 --> 00:00:17,020
with those fundamentals.
7

7
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,460
Because in this section,
8

8
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,140
you learned a lot about these fundamentals.
9

9
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,810
You practiced a lot.
10

10
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:25,410
You practiced all these things you learned early
11

11
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:27,620
in the course, and you worked a lot
12

12
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:32,120
with all those built in core components with styling,
13

13
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,470
and you learned how you can build your own components
14

14
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,820
based on these core components,
15

15
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,190
how you can build general UI components
16

16
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:43,080
as well as app specific components.
17

17
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,420
You learned how you can switch
18

18
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,870
between multiple screens here simply
19

19
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,610
with help of State and if statements.
20

20
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:52,010
Later, we will also learn a different approach,
21

21
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,390
but this approach is perfect for simple apps
22

22
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,300
like this one here.
23

23
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,100
You learned in general how you can
24

24
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,100
use these core React features,
25

25
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:05,040
like State or useEffect in React Native apps,
26

26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,490
and you learned how you can implement such a game
27

27
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:09,470
with React Native.
28

28
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:12,570
Now we did have a look at a lot of special cases.
29

29
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,160
You learned some tips and tricks
30

30
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,680
regarding styling and laying things out,
31

31
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,300
and for example, building custom buttons -
32

32
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,340
and that's what I mean.
33

33
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,550
I can only encourage you to build up on that
34

34
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:27,260
and practice all these things in your own demo apps.
35

35
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,260
Dive into the official docs
36

36
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:32,830
and get comfortable working with those core components
37

37
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:35,633
and with styling those components.
38

38
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,490
Now the final app we built here
39

39
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,140
could definitely be improved even more.
40

40
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,110
You could extract more components,
41

41
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,010
you could build more reusable components.
42

42
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:49,820
You could maybe use this style cascading effect
43

43
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,290
which we use here with the instruction text
44

44
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,250
where we merge an incoming style
45

45
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,290
with a built-in default style.
46

46
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,520
You could definitely use all these things
47

47
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,833
in different parts of this game.
48

48
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,010
I did not optimize all that code
49

49
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:05,700
in the best possible way,
50

50
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,300
because I A: Wanted to keep related concepts
51

51
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,630
and styles together to a certain extent,
52

52
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:17,370
and B: this already is a huge section and we wanna move on
53

53
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:21,740
and learn more exciting features React Native has to offer.
54

54
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,960
For example, in the next core section, we're going to build
55

55
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,340
up on this game and we're going to make sure
56

56
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:32,150
that it adapts to different screen sizes and platforms.
57

57
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:35,400
That we render slightly different styles
58

58
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,996
or layouts on different platforms,
59

59
00:02:37,996 --> 00:02:41,400
that we can for example rotate the device,
60

60
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,850
and then also use this in landscape mode
61

61
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:46,860
instead of just portrait mode,
62

62
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,470
and a couple of other are interesting things.
63

63
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,470
That's what we will explore next, but for the moment
64

64
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,193
that's it for this section.
