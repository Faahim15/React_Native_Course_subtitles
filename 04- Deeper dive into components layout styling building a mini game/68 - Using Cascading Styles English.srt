1
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:04,950
So let's now continue on this game screen
2

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,853
with these buttons here.
3

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:09,740
Here in the game screen,
4

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,603
we already have this card as a container.
5

5
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:15,980
Then we have this view, which holds these two buttons.
6

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,940
And I'd like to position these buttons next to each other.
7

7
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:22,230
For this, we need to convert this view
8

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,950
from flex direction column,
9

9
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:26,743
which is the default to flex direction row.
10

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,210
Therefore that's what I'll do.
11

11
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:32,930
I'll add a buttons container here.
12

12
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:35,590
And as a side note, we have a similar container
13

13
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:37,070
on the start game screen.
14

14
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,050
And yes, we could outsource this
15

15
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:42,140
into a separate reusable component as well.
16

16
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,570
Here I'll not do it because it's just one line
17

17
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,770
of code, one line of styling anyways.
18

18
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:47,880
This line here.
19

19
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,240
But you could absolutely create a reusable component
20

20
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,820
for this button row as well,
21

21
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,090
if you wanted to.
22

22
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,210
You could even create a reusable component
23

23
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:57,900
that holds these two buttons,
24

24
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,690
if you wanted to do that.
25

25
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:02,470
That would absolutely be possible.
26

26
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:04,640
Here I will not do that though,
27

27
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,440
to keep things a bit simpler.
28

28
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,810
I will just add this view.
29

29
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:12,210
And again, wrap these individual buttons interviews
30

30
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:16,590
for the same reasons as before on the start game screen.
31

31
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,710
And then I can copy
32

32
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:22,520
over the button and buttons container style,
33

33
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,563
these two style objects, and add them here.
34

34
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,970
And then I'll add these styles to these views.
35

35
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:34,210
So this outer view receives the buttons container
36

36
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:39,210
and this interview receives the button container, like this.
37

37
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,683
And also this button.
38

38
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,920
With that done, if we save this, this looks better
39

39
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,510
just some spacing would maybe be nice.
40

40
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:53,800
And to achieve that,
41

41
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,780
I actually wanna add some spacing below the instruction text
42

42
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,133
or above this buttons container row.
43

43
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,240
Now we could easily add it to this buttons container row
44

44
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,450
but I'll add it to the instruction text
45

45
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:07,970
so that I can also show you
46

46
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:10,770
another key concept and technique
47

47
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,280
that you you will likely use quite a bit when working
48

48
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,840
with React Native, keep in mind that we're not using CSS,
49

49
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,100
so we have no cascading styles.
50

50
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,260
We have no inheritance.
51

51
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:26,400
But we can kind of replicate a similar behavior.
52

52
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,570
What if we want to add some extra styles
53

53
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:31,850
to this instruction text that should be applied in
54

54
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:34,730
addition to the styles applied already
55

55
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:38,210
inside of the instruction text component?
56

56
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:42,130
Well, we can use props in the instruction
57

57
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:43,090
text component.
58

58
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:45,000
Besides getting the children,
59

59
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,490
we could expect a style prop.
60

60
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:50,570
Though the name is up to you and doesn't have to be style,
61

61
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,410
but I will use style since that is the prop we used
62

62
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:56,363
on all these other components all the time for styling.
63

63
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:01,000
So now we get this style prop here on instruction text
64

64
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,140
and we can now merge the styles we get from this style prop
65

65
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:08,850
with the styles, we set up inside of this component,
66

66
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:13,040
which allows us to kind of build such a cascading structure
67

67
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,360
because we can now pass styles
68

68
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,390
from a parent component into this component
69

69
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:21,343
and merge it with the component specific styles.
70

70
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,980
Now this can easily be achieved
71

71
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,350
by wrapping our styles into an array here.
72

72
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:31,060
Because the style prop does not just take style objects,
73

73
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,410
it also takes an array of style objects.
74

74
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:36,830
If you do pass an array, by the way,
75

75
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:41,120
the items are parsed and evaluated from left to right.
76

76
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,750
So the right items, and the styles defined
77

77
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,320
in the right items, can overwrite the styles defined
78

78
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,693
in the earlier items.
79

79
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:52,770
So here I add the style that's coming in through props
80

80
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,910
and I add it as a last item
81

81
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,830
so that we could overwrite styles that are defined
82

82
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:00,200
in this default style set here.
83

83
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,750
So that we could override these default styles from outside,
84

84
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,963
and for example, assign a bigger font size if we wanted to.
85

85
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,820
So now we accepted this style prop.
86

86
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,350
We added to this array and we added such
87

87
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:16,180
that the default styles could be overwritten,
88

88
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,830
but we can of course now also add new styles
89

89
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:22,280
besides overriding default styles, by simply going
90

90
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,950
to the place where this component is used,
91

91
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,800
in this case the game screen,
92

92
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,730
and adding this new style prop
93

93
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:31,630
as a prop to instruction text.
94

94
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:35,310
And then here, I'll add a new style object.
95

95
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:38,940
The instruction text object, for example,
96

96
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,033
name is up to you,
97

97
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:44,590
and I'll add a margin to the bottom of 12.
98

98
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,750
So I'm not overriding any styles.
99

99
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,803
I'm just setting an additional margin to the bottom.
100

100
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,360
And now we can add this here like that
101

101
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:58,930
but this is an important technique,
102

102
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:03,040
which allows you to rebuild this cascading nature of CSS
103

103
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,810
in react native, by simply passing this style prop
104

104
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:10,190
into a component and then merging the incoming styles
105

105
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:13,750
with the existing styles, possibly as we're doing it here
106

106
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:17,500
such that you could override the default styles.
107

107
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,360
Though of course you could also add style
108

108
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,270
in front of the default styles if you want to ensure
109

109
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:25,260
that the default styles override the incoming styles,
110

110
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,510
if there are any clashes.
111

111
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,030
This is up to you
112

112
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:31,520
and depends on the exact use case you have.
113

113
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,040
Here I will add it such
114

114
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,653
that we could override the default styles.
115

115
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,860
And with this, we now have this margin to the bottom
116

116
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:43,193
and a bit more spacing between this text and the buttons.
