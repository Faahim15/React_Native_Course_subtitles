1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:05,450
So we worked on this start game screen.
2

2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:08,590
We worked on this game screen and of course,
3

3
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:11,630
as mentioned before you can definitely fine tune this
4

4
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:13,080
to your likings.
5

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,000
Now, I wanna work on this game over screen
6

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
because of course this screen is not that pretty right now.
7

7
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,410
Now for this, let's switch to the game over screen.
8

8
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:25,323
What do we wanna do on this screen?
9

9
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:30,050
Well, I think it makes sense to show a game over title,
10

10
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:33,190
maybe a nice image and then below that image,
11

11
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:35,480
also a short summary of the game.
12

12
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:39,340
How many turns it took the computer, the phone
13

13
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:42,710
to guess our number and what our number actually was.
14

14
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,500
I think that could make a lot of sense.
15

15
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,190
And for this, to achieve this,
16

16
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:52,920
I will start by replacing this text here
17

17
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,570
in the game over screen with a View,
18

18
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:57,300
with a general container,
19

19
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,550
which we of course have to import
20

20
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:00,950
because as you learned by now
21

21
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:03,660
that is very often the first thing you do
22

22
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,810
since the View is this generic container component
23

23
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,040
that contains all your other elements
24

24
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,810
that make up a screen or a more complex component.
25

25
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:15,740
Now in here, I then wanna have my title
26

26
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:18,680
and I will reuse this existing title component
27

27
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,430
which I import from components UI title,
28

28
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:23,980
but of course you could also build a different title,
29

29
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:27,180
specifically for this page, if you wanted to.
30

30
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,563
I will reuse this existing title and say game over.
31

31
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:36,180
And then below this title, I'd like to have an image.
32

32
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,663
An image which I then also want to style.
33

33
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,870
For this we can use this image component
34

34
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:47,610
which we need to import from React Native as you learned,
35

35
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:51,900
and then for the image, I prepare the image for you.
36

36
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,580
Now, we already got the assets, images folder
37

37
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,530
and therefore you should simply download
38

38
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:00,260
and drag and drop that image into this images folder.
39

39
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:03,050
It's this success PNG file.
40

40
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:06,060
So now that's the image which I'd like to display here,
41

41
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,230
and for this, we can add a source here, as we always did
42

42
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:16,230
and require this from the assets folder like this,
43

43
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,560
and then there from images, it's success.png
44

44
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,163
that's the image I wanna add.
45

45
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,970
Now, on this image I then want to add some styling,
46

46
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,710
but for the moment let's just save this
47

47
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,700
and take a look at that.
48

48
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,610
So now we got the title and we got the image
49

49
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:36,150
and the image is way too big, as you can tell.
50

50
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:38,010
And it's way too big on purpose
51

51
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:41,240
because as mentioned I wanna show you how you can resize
52

52
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,330
and style the image and for example,
53

53
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,290
I also wanna create round image,
54

54
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:49,129
so a circle, and we can achieve this with style properties
55

55
00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:51,233
which will dive into next.
56

56
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,250
For that, I will import Stylesheet
57

57
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,200
into this game over screen component
58

58
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,817
and create the styles object as we did it many times before.
59

59
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:08,870
Stylesheet create, and then create a style for our image.
60

60
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:13,770
And now when it comes to creating an image
61

61
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:16,800
with rounded corners, what works best is
62

62
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,220
that you create a View around your image,
63

63
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,800
and then on that View you add rounded corners,
64

64
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,520
and you add overflow hidden as we also did it earlier
65

65
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:32,060
for our custom button, if you remember this.
66

66
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,600
There we also worked with this kind of approach,
67

67
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,830
having a container with borderRadius and overflow hidden,
68

68
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:40,423
we'll do something similar for this image now.
69

69
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,150
And therefore here I'll add the imageContainer style,
70

70
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:50,053
where I add a borderRadius of let's say 200
71

71
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:56,170
and a width of 400 and a height of 400.
72

72
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:00,000
And the borderRadius should be half your width or height,
73

73
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,560
and width and height should be the same amount
74

74
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,340
so that we create a square and then by setting border radius
75

75
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:10,800
to half our width or height, we actually create a circle.
76

76
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,320
That is how we can create such a circle image.
77

77
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,470
And then we'll also add a border width of three here
78

78
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:20,460
to add a little border around that image
79

79
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:24,520
and the border color then can be any color you want.
80

80
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,470
I will use my colors constant, which is therefore imported
81

81
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:33,220
from constants colors, and on this colors constant,
82

82
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:36,930
I wanna choose a dark shade of my primary color,
83

83
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:41,870
like primary 800, which goes into the vlack color,
84

84
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,060
but isn't black
85

85
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,853
but still has some plum color elements to it.
86

86
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,220
Now, very important as mentioned,
87

87
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,990
we also wanna add overflow hidden, to make sure
88

88
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:57,410
that we hide the square or the rectangular nature
89

89
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:01,080
of the actual image and we use this container as an overlay,
90

90
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,693
as a mask for this image, you could say.
91

91
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:08,690
And I will also add a vertical margin or actually a margin
92

92
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:11,270
in all directions here on that image,
93

93
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:14,333
and here, let's say we wanna add a margin of,
94

94
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:19,023
let's say 36 pixels and we can of course tweak this later.
95

95
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,930
Now, this style will be applied to this view
96

96
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:25,580
which is the container for this image.
97

97
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,433
So hence I add it like this.
98

98
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,770
The image itself will now (indistinct) receive some styling
99

99
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:35,620
and for this I'll create an image style property
100

100
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,720
and all I do here is set the width to 100%
101

101
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,250
and the height to 100%.
102

102
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:46,040
And that 100% will refer to the container,
103

103
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,850
to the View in which the image is placed.
104

104
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:53,050
That's how percentage values always work in React Native.
105

105
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,970
They refer to the container of the element
106

106
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:59,580
on which you set up those percentage values.
107

107
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,910
So in this case, I will add this style,
108

108
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:06,740
this styles.image style to the image,
109

109
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,710
and therefore the percentage width and height
110

110
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,810
on that image will refer to the width
111

111
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:13,610
and height of the View that holds the image,
112

112
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,823
and that of course will be 400 each.
113

113
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,693
With that applied, if we save this,
114

114
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:23,320
now we got this circular image here.
115

115
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,660
Now it's a little bit too big,
116

116
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,680
and in the next core section.
117

117
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,730
We're going to learn how we can adapt this dynamically
118

118
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:33,250
to the available device size.
119

119
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,980
For the moment I'll find unit manually
120

120
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:40,980
and decrease this to 300 pixels height and width
121

121
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,500
and hence the border radius to 150,
122

122
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,673
so that it's still half the width.
123

123
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:50,320
With this, this looks better I'd say.
124

124
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,450
Now, in addition I also wanna have some general distance
125

125
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:58,820
to the top and some padding around the title and so on,
126

126
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:03,100
and therefore it makes sense to wrap this overall thing here
127

127
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,440
into a View, which we already did,
128

128
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,470
which receives some styling as well.
129

129
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,830
And for this, I'm going to add my good old screen
130

130
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:16,830
or rootContainer styling property,
131

131
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,430
my styling object to be precise and add flex one,
132

132
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:24,530
so that we take all the available space.
133

133
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:28,180
Then I'll add some padding, let's say 24 pixels,
134

134
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:31,760
and I wanna center the entire content in the middle
135

135
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,530
both horizontally and vertically and this can be achieved,
136

136
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:40,530
by using justifyContent center and alignItems center.
137

137
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,450
This will center it on both axis
138

138
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:45,700
and therefore it will be centered horizontally
139

139
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,913
and vertically.
140

140
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:51,540
And now this rootContainer style just needs to be applied
141

141
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:54,823
to this View, which wraps this entire content like this.
142

142
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,140
With that, we got this look
143

143
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,763
and this doesn't look too bad I'd say.
144

144
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,040
Now this is not everything I wanna do though,
145

145
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,450
instead as I said below the image,
146

146
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:10,470
I wanna output a short summary of the game.
147

147
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:13,870
And for this, we can go back to the JSX code
148

148
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:16,320
and then, below this imageContainer,
149

149
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,170
we can add another View,
150

150
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:21,890
simply to group together some text elements,
151

151
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:23,940
though we might actually not need that,
152

152
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,410
so let's just start with a text right away,
153

153
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,740
now that I think about this.
154

154
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:32,490
And for this of course text should be imported here
155

155
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:35,230
from React Native, and then in this text,
156

156
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:39,773
I wanna say your phone needed X rounds
157

157
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,860
to guess the number Y.
158

158
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,320
And of course X and Y are place holders
