1
00:00:02,345 --> 00:00:06,267
Now to highlight X and Y we can wrap X and Y
2

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:12,340
in extra text elements, in extra text Components.
3

3
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,750
And this is something we haven't done
4

4
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,420
up to this point in this course
5

5
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:19,040
but it is something that is absolutely fine
6

6
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,230
and which you can do with React Native.
7

7
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,530
A text Component, actually can't hold
8

8
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,870
too many other kinds of Components.
9

9
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:32,003
For example, a text Component should not really wrap a view,
10

10
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:37,290
but a text Component can contain other text Components.
11

11
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,880
So having a text Component besides the plain text
12

12
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,770
in another text Component is allowed
13

13
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,110
and is absolutely something you can do.
14

14
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:51,020
And what this allows us to do is add different styling
15

15
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,760
to this text than to the rest of this text.
16

16
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,780
So therefore here I'll add another text wrapper
17

17
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,460
around the Y and then we can prepare some styles
18

18
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:05,523
for this text in general, and then for the X and Y texts.
19

19
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:09,450
Now let's start with the text in general.
20

20
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:14,220
For this, I'll add the summary text styling property,
21

21
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,580
and here I just wanna set the font family to open sense.
22

22
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,750
That's basically all I wanna do,
23

23
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:24,610
but then I also wanna add a highlight styling object here,
24

24
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:27,020
where I set the font family to open sense
25

25
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,500
bold so that we have some bold text
26

26
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,790
and where the color is set to colors primary 500
27

27
00:01:34,382 --> 00:01:36,853
so that we assign a color to that text.
28

28
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,640
And now we can use these styling objects
29

29
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,980
to style the text and the texts inside the text.
30

30
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,930
The wrapping text receives the style prop
31

31
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:49,900
to assume the styles.
32

32
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,620
Summary text, styling
33

33
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,170
and the inner texts
34

34
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:59,170
that wrap X and Y receive style=styles.highlight
35

35
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:02,023
both these texts receive that.
36

36
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:06,230
And we could again create a reusable component for that
37

37
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,670
but here this is all the pretty reusable
38

38
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,220
since we assigned the same reusable style
39

39
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,053
to these two text Components.
40

40
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:18,890
With that we now got this summary text below this image.
41

41
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:22,600
Now, when I look at it, I'm not totally happy with that.
42

42
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,380
To make this a bit prettier
43

43
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:27,040
I actually wanna increase the text size.
44

44
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,150
So on the summary text, I'll ramp up the font size to 24
45

45
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,950
and now this is bigger.
46

46
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:36,720
And please note that the text that's nested
47

47
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,040
into another text element also is resized.
48

48
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,920
This is not inheritance at work,
49

49
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,350
but instead this is related
50

50
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:48,300
to how this is compiled to a Native Component internally.
51

51
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,690
If we have a view that contains a text
52

52
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:52,825
and we add a font size to the view
53

53
00:02:52,825 --> 00:02:57,825
it would not affect any nested text elements in the view.
54

54
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,340
Nested text elements inside of other text elements
55

55
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:05,190
however, are affected by the text specific styles
56

56
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:08,660
you do set on the parent text Component though.
57

57
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:11,180
Though when we set a font size on the outer text
58

58
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:14,490
the nested texts are also affected.
59

59
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:15,700
That in the end works
60

60
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,750
as you would expect it to work, I guess
61

61
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,993
and it's definitely worth noting that it works like this.
62

62
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:26,700
So now we have this styling, centering the text
63

63
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,180
would also be nice still.
64

64
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,540
So I will also add text align center here
65

65
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,410
for the summary text,
66

66
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:35,813
so that this is centered like this.
67

67
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,570
Now last but not least below all of that,
68

68
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:41,270
I'd like to have a button that allows us
69

69
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:43,380
to start a new game.
70

70
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:46,920
So below of this text, I'll add the primary button
71

71
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,530
which therefore of course must be imported
72

72
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,973
from Components UI primary button.
73

73
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:57,440
And then on this primary button, I'll say start new game
74

74
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,320
and we will later add the on press prop
75

75
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,743
to trigger some function that does start a new game.
76

76
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,390
When we save this, we have this button here as well
77

77
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,460
and now maybe some spacing would be nice
78

78
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,720
so on that summary text
79

79
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,450
we can actually add a margin vertical
80

80
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:17,963
so margin top and bottom of 24 maybe.
81

81
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,670
With that there is some spacing
82

82
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,650
between the button and the text.
83

83
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,800
and actually, maybe we just want margin
84

84
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,208
to the bottom, now that I look at it
85

85
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:31,423
yeah, I think that looks nicer.
86

86
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:37,230
So now we have that, we have this game over screen finished
87

87
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:40,280
at least regarding the styling and the layout
88

88
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,850
but what's missing is of course that data
89

89
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,250
how many rounds we took?
90

90
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,960
and what the number was?
91

91
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,980
And this button is not working.
92

92
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,683
So that will be the next steps we will work on.
