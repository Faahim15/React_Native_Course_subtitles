1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,580
So as a next step,
2

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,400
I wanna make sure that we have a nice background
3

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,620
behind this input element.
4

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,220
And for a start, I wanna add a nice little color
5

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,590
in the back, which we will then change to a gradient
6

6
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:17,480
which we will then change to a background image
7

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,730
plus a gradient.
8

8
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:23,350
But let's start with a single background color.
9

9
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:25,530
You learned before that there are different ways
10

10
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:26,390
of setting that.
11

11
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:29,260
You can, for example, go to App Json
12

12
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,060
to this configuration file
13

13
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:34,900
and add a backgroundColor property here
14

14
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,980
and set this to a hex code that will then be applied
15

15
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,410
as a background color to the screen.
16

16
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,683
And this would be a fine way of doing that.
17

17
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:45,770
What I will do instead though is,
18

18
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:49,160
I will add a background color with help of a view.
19

19
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,130
And for this I'll go to app.js
20

20
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:54,380
because once I add more screens
21

21
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:58,930
they will actually still end up in this root app component.
22

22
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:01,750
So these different screens which I will add later
23

23
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:04,980
will still share this app component as a root.
24

24
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,530
So therefore any background color we set here
25

25
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,770
around this View, around this screen, I mean,
26

26
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,120
will be applied to all screens later,
27

27
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,163
once we start adding them to app.
28

28
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,110
Therefore here I will add a View
29

29
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,700
around the StartGameScreen, like this,
30

30
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,650
of course for a View to work,
31

31
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:27,370
we need to import it from react-native though,
32

32
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:29,063
otherwise it's not available.
33

33
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,710
So now we got this View here around our StartGameScreen.
34

34
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:37,270
Now we can add some styling to this View.
35

35
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:38,850
And for a start,
36

36
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,710
I will add my screen or my rootScreen
37

37
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:45,503
whatever you wanna name it, style object here.
38

38
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,150
And I'll set a backgroundColor
39

39
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:52,100
which should be a nice yellow color.
40

40
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,310
And I'll pick that yellow color, which I chose here
41

41
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,930
for my input element in the StartGameScreen.
42

42
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,823
I'll use that same color here.
43

43
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:06,870
Now we can apply this root screen style to this View here
44

44
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,853
by using styles.rootScreen.
45

45
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:14,860
Now, if we save this, it only covers this part at the top.
46

46
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,053
And do you know why?
47

47
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:19,220
Because it only takes up the space
48

48
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:22,200
it must take up by default
49

49
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,110
and that's really important to memorize.
50

50
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,820
Views only take as much space
51

51
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:31,660
as they need to fit their content into themselves.
52

52
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:36,430
And the content of this root View is this StartGameScreen
53

53
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:40,160
which in turn is just this input area.
54

54
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,710
So it's this input box
55

55
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:45,440
plus the margin reserved by this input box.
56

56
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,680
Now, if I wanna apply this color to the entire screen
57

57
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,640
what can we do?
58

58
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,270
Well, we can use flex: 1.
59

59
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:58,460
If we add flex: 1 here, this container, this View,
60

60
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,150
which receives this style
61

61
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:03,740
will take up as much space as available.
62

62
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:07,930
So by adding flex: 1 here, now everything is yellow.
63

63
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:11,200
So that's how we can add such a background color
64

64
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,170
with a View.
65

65
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:15,440
It's a nice first step, but as a next step
66

66
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,713
we will switch to a gradient instead.
