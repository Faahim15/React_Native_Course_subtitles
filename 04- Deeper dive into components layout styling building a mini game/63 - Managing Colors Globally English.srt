1
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:03,380
Now in the previous lecture
2

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:05,220
we added this title component.
3

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,820
And by doing so we made sure that
4

4
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:09,310
we had this reusable title.
5

5
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,680
But speaking of reusability
6

6
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:15,650
and repeating certain things and settings,
7

7
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:17,810
you might have noticed that these colors
8

8
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:21,690
which I'm using are used in different places of the app.
9

9
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:24,100
I'm using colors in the Start GameScreen,
10

10
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,520
in the primary button component,
11

11
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,720
in the title component.
12

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,260
And having all these colors in all these places
13

13
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,520
is not ideal.
14

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,920
It's just as in web development with CSS.
15

15
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,510
If you're using the same colors in different places
16

16
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,790
which you typically are, repeating them manually is annoying
17

17
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:46,260
because you always have to copy the exact same hex codes,
18

18
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,790
and if you would change to color at some point
19

19
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:51,830
and even if it's just a slight change, a small change,
20

20
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:54,580
you would have to apply that in different files
21

21
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:57,153
of your project, which of course is not great.
22

22
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:01,450
Now in CSS, you could solve this problem
23

23
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:05,640
by using CSS variables, CSS custom properties.
24

24
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,400
But this feature doesn't exist with React Native
25

25
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,040
because we're not using CSS here.
26

26
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,050
Therefore what is commonly done in React Native,
27

27
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:16,480
is that you create a helper file
28

28
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,740
that exposes certain constant values
29

29
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,453
like the colors you're using.
30

30
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,270
And for this I'll add a new folder,
31

31
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:28,020
which you could name Util for utility
32

32
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,100
or constants or whatever you want.
33

33
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,760
And I'll go for constants
34

34
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,453
because I'll manage some constant reused values in there,
35

35
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:41,313
and then I'll add a colors JS file in there.
36

36
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:46,190
And in this file, I'll create a colors constant
37

37
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:49,133
which is just a regular Javascript object.
38

38
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,010
But in this object, I'm now going to set up
39

39
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:55,530
various properties which I'll reuse over and over again
40

40
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,140
throughout this app.
41

41
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,270
For example, a primary color.
42

42
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:01,700
And since I plan on managing multiple shades
43

43
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,840
of the primary color, I'll name this primary500.
44

44
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,380
It doesn't have to be 500,
45

45
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,950
it could be primary 1 and 2 and so on,
46

46
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:14,450
but I will indicate how saturated or dark a shade is
47

47
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:19,253
by higher or lower numbers after the main property name.
48

48
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:25,110
Now my primary500 number could be this primary plum color
49

49
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:31,080
which I have here in my by button for example.
50

50
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,693
So in colors, I'll set this here as my primary500 color.
51

51
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:42,300
Now we can export this colors constant here as a default,
52

52
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:46,380
and import it in all the places where this color is needed
53

53
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,390
like in the primary button
54

54
00:02:50,116 --> 00:02:51,890
There, we also have a different shade by the way,
55

55
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,490
because of the ripple effect.
56

56
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:55,430
It's a slightly darker shade,
57

57
00:02:55,430 --> 00:03:00,430
so I'll go to my colors constant and also add primary600
58

58
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,823
to store this shade here as well.
59

59
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,030
And then in primary button as mentioned,
60

60
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:11,800
we can import colors from going up one level,
61

61
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,500
diving into the constant folder,
62

62
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,740
and then into the colors file,
63

63
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,060
and now here we wanna use the darker shade,
64

64
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:23,863
so I access colors.primary600 to use that constant value.
65

65
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,530
And down here in the style sheet,
66

66
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:28,700
we can use this constant array as well,
67

67
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,503
and I can access colors primary500.
68

68
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,990
And if we would change the colors here in this colors file,
69

69
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:39,090
those changes would be applied to all the components
70

70
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,920
where we import this constant.
71

71
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,810
That's the advantage of using this approach.
72

72
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:48,310
Because now we can manage the colors in one global place,
73

73
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:51,140
and then use these colors in multiple components
74

74
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:54,430
and changes therefore only have to be made in one place,
75

75
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,693
instead of many places.
76

76
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:59,020
So I'll go to all the other places
77

77
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,770
where I'm using these colors as well.
78

78
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,163
To start GameScreen,
79

79
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,690
though there I'm not using this plum color as it seems
80

80
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:10,391
so no change needs to be made there.
81

81
00:04:10,391 --> 00:04:12,950
(gasps) I am using it here and even darker shade.
82

82
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:16,780
So let's cut this from Start GameScreen,
83

83
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:21,570
and add this darker shade maybe as primary800,
84

84
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:24,040
to leave an extra space for in between shade
85

85
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,453
if we should need it and add this here,
86

86
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,100
and then in Start GameScreen,
87

87
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:34,100
we also wanna import colors from going up, constants,
88

88
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:37,960
colors like this...
89

89
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:44,420
We can then use this down here and use colors.primary800
90

90
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,803
which was this super dark shade we added.
91

91
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,640
And we cannot also add the yellow color here.
92

92
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,450
This is our accent color, so the alternative color.
93

93
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:57,290
So I'll name this accent500
94

94
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:59,680
and store the yellow color here.
95

95
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,480
And then again in the GameScreen,
96

96
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,230
in the places where we need that...
97

97
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:05,340
Sorry, in the Start GameScreen,
98

98
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,830
we can replace this hard coded text code
99

99
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,430
with colors accent500.
100

100
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:13,193
So do that here and here.
101

101
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:17,070
And we're using that same yellow color
102

102
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,720
in the title component,
103

103
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,750
so therefore here we cannot also import colors
104

104
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:26,010
from going up, constants colors,
105

105
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:29,530
and use that instead of the hard coded yellow values here.
106

106
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:34,100
So that we have colors accent500 here for the text color
107

107
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,883
and then also for the border color.
108

108
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:40,490
And that's how we can use these color constants
109

109
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:42,373
in those various components.
110

110
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,900
Now we don't use any colors in App.js...
111

111
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,190
Oh yes we do, here.
112

112
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,690
So let's also import it there.
113

113
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:54,483
Import, colors from./constant/colors.
114

114
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:00,260
And then here, this should be...
115

115
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:03,020
It's an extra shade actually as I can see,
116

116
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,073
so we might want to add that.
117

117
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:10,970
And this looks like a shade between primary600 and 800.
118

118
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,803
So it's good that we left some space here.
119

119
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,910
Yeah, I think it fits in there,
120

120
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,530
and now we can use that.
121

121
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,840
We can use this newly added color,
122

122
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,840
add this primary700 shade here in this App file,
123

123
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,670
and then this is our default yellow,
124

124
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:33,263
so here we can use our accent500 color.
125

125
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:39,280
With that if we save this, this should work again
126

126
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,870
and we should have the same look can feel as before.
127

127
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:45,360
Also if I reload and end up on the starting screen,
128

128
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,620
this looks good, but now we're managing this
129

129
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:51,193
in a global place with all the advantages I outlined.
