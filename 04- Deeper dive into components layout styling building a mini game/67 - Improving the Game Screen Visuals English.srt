1
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:04,830
So, let's now finalize these screens,
2

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,543
and for this I wanna start on that StartGameScreen again.
3

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,680
I wanna improve this screen a little bit
4

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,370
and I, for example, wanna add my title
5

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,423
above this input area.
6

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,030
And for that, if we go to the StartGameScreen,
7

7
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:22,800
we have to actually add another view
8

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,650
because at the moment everything on this screen
9

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,770
is only this input area.
10

10
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:31,673
This entire view here is this entire input area container.
11

11
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:35,220
So, I will add another view on this screen,
12

12
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,070
in the StartGameScreen Component here,
13

13
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,900
and then in there above this container
14

14
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,520
that holds the TextInput (indistinct) on,
15

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,170
I wanna add my Title Component that I created before,
16

16
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:50,563
which is imported from components/ui/Title.
17

17
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,030
And in that Title Component
18

18
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,480
we could say something like guess my number
19

19
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,510
because that is the title of the game, let's say.
20

20
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:01,630
With that we got this title here,
21

21
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:04,230
but of course this is not looking good.
22

22
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,310
Having this sit on the top edge
23

23
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,790
is not looking good at all.
24

24
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,090
To change this positioning
25

25
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:15,270
I will add another property here in my StyleSheet,
26

26
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,520
and name it screenContainer or rootContainer,
27

27
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,100
maybe that is a fitting name.
28

28
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,160
And here I wanna set up flex one,
29

29
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,290
so that whatever receives this style
30

30
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,703
takes up as much space as possible.
31

31
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:32,420
And here I also wanna add marginTop 100,
32

32
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:35,700
and actually reduce marginTop in the inputContainer
33

33
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,823
now to, let's say, 36.
34

34
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:42,420
And then we can add this rootContainer style
35

35
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,110
to this view here,
36

36
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:47,900
so we add the style prop and point at styles rootContainer.
37

37
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,970
With that this looks nicer
38

38
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,920
but I also don't want that title
39

39
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,470
to stretch from left to right.
40

40
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:59,390
Now, there certainly would be different ways of fixing this
41

41
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,760
but the way I will choose here
42

42
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,840
is that on that rootContainer
43

43
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,189
I simply change alignItems,
44

44
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:09,230
which aligns items across the cross axis,
45

45
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:11,420
which in this case is left to right,
46

46
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,650
from stretch, which is the default
47

47
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,040
which leads to this title being stretched, to center.
48

48
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,310
And with that it's not stretched anymore
49

49
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,163
but instead centered like this.
50

50
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,940
So that's an enhancement, I would say.
51

51
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,550
What I also wanna change
52

52
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:30,570
is that I wanna have a little instruction here
53

53
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:34,060
inside of that inputContainer box,
54

54
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,760
a little instruction that tells me
55

55
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,323
that I should enter a number that then has to be guessed.
56

56
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:44,550
So, for this, above this TextInput we can add a text,
57

57
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,440
a regular text,
58

58
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,610
which we of course have to import from React Native,
59

59
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:50,443
like this.
60

60
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:56,500
And in this text here we can then say enter a number,
61

61
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:00,923
like this.
62

62
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:05,100
Now, of course, this is totally not readable
63

63
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,410
so we need to add some styling here.
64

64
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:12,410
And for the styling I will add another style property here,
65

65
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:18,420
the instructionText property maybe.
66

66
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:21,333
And we can give the text a color of Colors.
67

67
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:27,113
lets try primary500, though that might be too dark.
68

68
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,973
And lets increase the font size to 24.
69

69
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:35,490
With that we can now add this to this text
70

70
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:36,870
by adding the style prop
71

71
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:39,053
and pointing at styles.instructionText,
72

72
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,750
and with this done we now got this instruction.
73

73
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,910
And I think it's not too easy to read
74

74
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:53,940
so as a workaround we could add a lighter shade,
75

75
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,970
but I think the better workaround is to make this yellow
76

76
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,370
since the number input field
77

77
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,710
also has yellow text, and so on.
78

78
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:03,810
And therefore I'll actually switch this
79

79
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:07,390
from primary500 to accent500,
80

80
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,980
to this yellow color which we stored.
81

81
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:13,950
And with this, yeah, that doesn't look too bad.
82

82
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,060
Now you could add more,
83

83
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,400
you could add an image to this screen,
84

84
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,290
enhance it in any way you want,
85

85
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:22,063
but I think this looks okay, this is decent.
86

86
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,310
I therefore would now wanna continue on this screen
87

87
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,693
where we actually play the game.
88

88
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,410
And on this screen, of course,
89

89
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:34,603
the buttons currently aren't that good looking.
90

90
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:38,870
I'm also not entirely happy with that number container
91

91
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,300
so I will work on this as well,
92

92
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,023
but I will start with the buttons.
93

93
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:46,610
I wanna group those buttons and the instruction text
94

94
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:49,490
that belongs to them in a box,
95

95
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:52,530
as we have it here on the StartGameScreen.
96

96
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:54,670
And actually I like the style of that box,
97

97
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,383
so I would like to use exactly the same box.
98

98
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,360
Now, since I plan on using exactly the same box
99

99
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,420
as I have it here on the StartGameScreen,
100

100
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:08,270
it makes sense to create a dedicated Component
101

101
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,463
that renders this box.
102

102
00:05:11,347 --> 00:05:13,140
So, in the so in the components ui folder
103

103
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,070
I'll add a Card.js file
104

104
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,680
because this kind of Component
105

105
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,940
that provides such a container with this kind of look
106

106
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,003
is typically called a card.
107

107
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:27,100
So, therefore here we have our Card function
108

108
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,313
and we export this as a default here,
109

109
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:36,490
and then we crab the Card related code from StartGameScreen.
110

110
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,020
And for this I'm not going to grab all that code
111

111
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,913
because, of course, the specific content
112

112
00:05:41,913 --> 00:05:45,290
that we have in this box on the StartGameScreen
113

113
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:46,750
should stay in that screen,
114

114
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,990
that's not what we wanna outsource into a generic component.
115

115
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:54,920
It's just the background, just the container itself.
116

116
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:59,270
And therefore it's actually this view here which I'll grab,
117

117
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:03,250
and return in here also with a closing tag.
118

118
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,980
And then in the Card component
119

119
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:08,180
I expect to get my children prop,
120

120
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:12,420
and I output this between the opening and closing view tags,
121

121
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,230
and that means that I can now use my Card Component
122

122
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:18,140
as a wrapper around any kind of content
123

123
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:22,083
to wrap this view with this style around that content.
124

124
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:24,280
Of course, for this to work
125

125
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,510
we also need to bring over the style, though,
126

126
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:30,363
and therefore I'll import the StyleSheet from React Native,
127

127
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:36,540
and create this styles constant here with StyleSheet create,
128

128
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,623
like this here.
129

129
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,940
And then in the StartGameScreen here,
130

130
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:46,020
we can grab this inputContainer style property,
131

131
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:49,530
which is responsible for styling this container,
132

132
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:52,770
this Card container, and cut that from StartGameScreen
133

133
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,660
and add it into this Card.js file
134

134
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,880
into the StyleSheet instead.
135

135
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,530
And I'll rename it to card
136

136
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:03,000
because this is now really the kind of style
137

137
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,553
we are applying here.
138

138
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:08,920
With that we can now use this Card Component
139

139
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,600
in the StartGameScreen,
140

140
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:15,600
and there we can import Card from components/ui/Card,
141

141
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,793
like that.
142

142
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,930
And now we just need to replace this view,
143

143
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:28,303
which is wrapped around our TextInput elements with Card,
144

144
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:33,250
and of course also replace the closing element
145

145
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,823
that belongs to that view.
146

146
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,780
And we can now also use this on GameScreen
147

147
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:41,330
to wrap this around our buttons there.
148

148
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:46,270
Here I wanna replace this view with Card,
149

149
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:49,130
also replace the closing view
150

150
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,790
and, of course, make sure that card is being imported
151

151
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:57,053
from the components/ui/Card file.
152

152
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:03,330
I also now wanna use my instruction text
153

153
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:05,990
that I defined here on StartGameScreen,
154

154
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:09,600
this text with that styling on the GameScreen
155

155
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,970
for this higher or lower text.
156

156
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:14,690
And, therefore, for the same reason,
157

157
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:17,120
we can create a Component.
158

158
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,290
The instructionText Component, or however you wanna name it.
159

159
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:23,633
The name, of course, is totally up to you.
160

160
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,223
But this also is a default React component, like this.
161

161
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:35,520
And in here we wanna return this text here,
162

162
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,560
which we have on the StartGameScreen
163

163
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,363
where we say enter a number,
164

164
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,700
and for this we then, of course, want to import Text
165

165
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,630
from React Native
166

166
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:51,410
and expect to get that children prop here as well,
167

167
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:54,320
so that we get this actual content
168

168
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,650
that should be rendered between the text tags
169

169
00:08:56,650 --> 00:09:00,020
from the place where this instructionText Component
170

170
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:00,883
will be used.
171

171
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:04,510
And then, again, we wanna bring ove the styles
172

172
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:07,160
because that's the primary reason for creating
173

173
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,770
this reusable Component,
174

174
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:12,140
so that we have the styles to find once in one place,
175

175
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,170
and we can then use it in different parts
176

176
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:16,470
of the application.
177

177
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:19,520
And we therefore create such a styles object here
178

178
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:24,140
with StyleSheet create, like this,
179

179
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:27,480
and then we go back to StartGameScreen,
180

180
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:32,140
we grab the instruction text styling here and cut that,
181

181
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:35,130
and bring that over here into the StyleSheet
182

182
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:36,763
so that this works there.
183

183
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,680
And, of course, this should not be content
184

184
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,823
but children here.
185

185
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,520
So, now with that
186

186
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,970
we can use this instructionText here
187

187
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:48,080
in the StartGameScreen Component,
188

188
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,770
instead of the regular Text Component.
189

189
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:55,080
We now use the instructionText also for the closing tag
190

190
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:59,120
and we get rid of this style assignment,
191

191
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,530
we don't have that style in this file anymore
192

192
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:02,763
and we don't need it.
193

193
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:06,740
And, of course, you should add this instructionText import
194

194
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,573
and on the other hand
195

195
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:10,140
we can rid of the Text Component import
196

196
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,380
because we're not using raw Text Component
197

197
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,803
in this file anymore.
198

198
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,700
And now in the GameScreen we can also use this,
199

199
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,030
we can replace this Text Component
200

200
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:23,133
with the instructionText, like that,
201

201
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,720
and make sure that we import this Component,
202

202
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,723
and we can also get rid of the Text Component import here.
203

203
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:34,330
With all those changes made, let's see if this works.
204

204
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:36,330
It looks like we have an error,
205

205
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:38,440
can't find variable colors.
206

206
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,350
Okay, so in the Card Component
207

207
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,660
I'm referring to this colors constant
208

208
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:48,180
and I'm doing the same thing here in the instructionText,
209

209
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:52,290
and in both Component files I'm missing the colors import
210

210
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:56,730
so, of course we should import this from constants colors
211

211
00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:00,790
and add this line of import to both the Card.js
212

212
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:04,270
as well as the instructionText.js files.
213

213
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:09,270
With that we're missing the variable view in Card,
214

214
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:12,060
and that makes sense I'm rendering a view
215

215
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,943
so of course we have to import this.
216

216
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:18,410
Now this should render successfully.
217

217
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,130
It crashed on Android as it seems
218

218
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:21,913
so let me restart it there.
219

219
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,600
And now we still have this box here
220

220
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:29,093
but we also have it on this GameScreen now.
221

221
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,670
There it's now just the positioning of the buttons
222

222
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,770
which I wanna change,
223

223
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:36,050
and then I got a couple of other things
224

224
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:38,113
I'd like to change as well.
