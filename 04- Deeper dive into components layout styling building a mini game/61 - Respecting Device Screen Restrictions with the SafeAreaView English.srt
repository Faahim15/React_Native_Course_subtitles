00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:03,420
Modern smartphones
2

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,390
often have notches like this.
3

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,530
Here it's the typical iPhone notch,
4

4
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:10,440
other devices have a smaller notch,
5

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,390
but often we do have notches like this.
6

6
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,100
And therefore we wanna add some distance
7

7
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,990
to make sure that our content isn't too close
8

8
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:20,033
or even under that notch.
9

9
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,050
But, of course, not all smartphones have such a notch,
10

10
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:27,410
and it's not the same size for all smartphones.
11

11
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:31,080
Therefore it would be nice if there would be some component
12

12
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,540
that would automatically detect
13

13
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,410
on which device we're running
14

14
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,180
and add an appropriate amount of spacing
15

15
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,470
around our content to allow for that notch
16

16
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,800
and for that status bar.
17

17
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,570
And it turns out that such a component, thankfully, exists
18

18
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,510
and it's even built into React Native.
19

19
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,803
It's the safe area view.
20

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,460
And actually I wanna wrap this view around all my screens,
21

21
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,610
not just around the game screen.
22

22
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:03,220
Therefore I will not import it in the game screen,
23

23
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,230
but instead in app JS
24

24
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,210
because there I wanna wrap it around
25

25
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:09,113
my entire screen content.
26

26
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:15,230
So here we can import the safe area view from React Native.
27

27
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:18,920
And then we use this view by simply wrapping it
28

28
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,260
around our main content.
29

29
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:23,800
Now I'll go inside of the linear gradient
30

30
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,470
and the image background,
31

31
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,750
because I do want that background to be under the notch.
32

32
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:33,320
I don't want my image to end here in front of the notch.
33

33
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,620
It should be below the notch instead.
34

34
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,220
So that's fine, but I do want to make sure
35

35
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,640
that my main content, my screen content,
36

36
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,010
is not going under that notch.
37

37
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:45,850
Therefore I'll add my safe area view here
38

38
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,793
and wrap it around this screen.
39

39
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,220
Now we just need to make sure that we also add style here
40

40
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,660
to the safe area view,
41

41
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,950
and we apply our root screen style to that as well,
42

42
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,380
so that we still make sure that all the available space,
43

43
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,970
minus the area that is reserved for the notch,
44

44
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:05,670
which will be taken care of automatically,
45

45
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,423
is made available for this inner content.
46

46
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,570
With that, if we save this
47

47
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:14,760
not much changes on the starting screen.
48

48
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,670
If I reload everything,
49

49
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:20,160
we can see this doesn't look too different, that's fine.
50

50
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,184
But on this other page,
51

51
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:24,760
we see that now this is pushed down further
52

52
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,543
and we do have this nice distance to the top.
53

53
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,490
If we have a look at this on, on Android.
54

54
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:33,580
We see that it's way further to the top
55

55
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:36,183
because there is no notch on this emulator.
56

56
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,720
So this is now looking better.
57

57
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,710
Some extra distance would still be nice.
58

58
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,010
So on the game screen,
59

59
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:44,950
I'm still going to ramp up the padding a little bit,
60

60
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,970
maybe to 24 pixels,
61

61
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:50,630
but we do use this in conjunction with the safe area view,
62

62
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:53,860
to make that we don't go under that notch.
63

63
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,970
And this is a super important technique and view,
64

64
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,310
which you will use a lot
65

65
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,910
because, of course, typically you wanna make sure
66

66
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:04,593
that your content is not hidden by not just like this.
