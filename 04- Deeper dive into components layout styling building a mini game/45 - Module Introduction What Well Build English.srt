1
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:06,560
Even though we had a first look at some important basics
2

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,190
like these core Components
3

3
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:12,390
and how you can style and debug your React Native apps,
4

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:15,800
we're only scratching the surface thus far.
5

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,440
It's time to dive deeper
6

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,750
and that's exactly what we'll do in this core section,
7

7
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:24,800
we're going to dig deeper into all these fundamentals,
8

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,700
into all these basics that you must know.
9

9
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:31,100
And for this, we're going to build a complete Demo App,
10

10
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,560
a brand new app,
11

11
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:37,560
a little game where you will be able to enter a number
12

12
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:40,090
between one and 99
13

13
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:43,640
and then it's the phone's task to guess your number
14

14
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,500
and you give the phone hints,
15

15
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,830
and then we'll see how many turns it takes the phone
16

16
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:50,503
to guess your number.
17

17
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,750
So it's a nice little game, a Number app, which we'll build.
18

18
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:59,100
And as you can already tell by looking at this app
19

19
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,690
there are some new concepts in there
20

20
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:05,480
like using gradients or background images.
21

21
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,830
We have multiple screens between which we'll navigate
22

22
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:10,570
and therefore we're going to dive
23

23
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,630
into many new Core Components.
24

24
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:16,820
We'll work on these Complex Layouts
25

25
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,510
and learn many things about creating layouts like this.
26

26
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:22,540
And we'll dive deeper into Styling
27

27
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:27,070
and learn about some brand new Styling techniques as well.
28

28
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:30,120
And last but definitely not least,
29

29
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:34,710
this is a React app after all, a React Native app,
30

30
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,840
but therefore also a React app
31

31
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,730
and hence we will also build reusable components.
32

32
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:42,650
We will build custom components
33

33
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:45,820
and we will ensure that we don't just create this app
34

34
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:50,580
in some way but in a good way by writing good code,
35

35
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:53,420
good react code to be precise.
36

36
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:56,890
So plenty of things to cover, by the end of this module
37

37
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:59,400
you will have a super deep understanding
38

38
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,750
of react native and of its fundamentals
39

39
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,043
and therefore let's dive right in.
