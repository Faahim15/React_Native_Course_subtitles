1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,090
So now, with the icons added,
2

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:05,750
let's talk about fonts
3

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:09,050
because we also sometimes wanna use custom fonts.
4

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:13,403
And again, thankfully Expo makes this pretty easy.
5

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,300
For this, we can go to the app component
6

6
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,340
because we wanna set up our own fonts
7

7
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,160
in the root component of the app
8

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,270
so that they are loaded when the app starts,
9

9
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:26,700
because custom fonts have to be loaded
10

10
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,410
and we wanna do this early on
11

11
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,253
when the app starts, typically.
12

12
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,660
Now custom fonts can be loaded
13

13
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,400
with help of a extra package.
14

14
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,430
This extra package must be installed
15

15
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,030
and we can do this with expo install,
16

16
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:44,670
and the package name is expo-font.
17

17
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,460
With that, this package gets installed into our project.
18

18
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,460
I still have the npm-start process running
19

19
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,350
in a different tab,
20

20
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:54,150
but I'm all installing this package.
21

21
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,110
And once this is installed in the app component,
22

22
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:01,260
we can import something from expo-font,
23

23
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,950
and that something is a hook,
24

24
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:06,740
a React Hook, exposed by this package,
25

25
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,053
the useFonts hook.
26

26
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,270
This hook can be called
27

27
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,760
and must be called in an app component.
28

28
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,496
In this case, in our root app component to load these fonts.
29

29
00:01:18,496 --> 00:01:19,930
UseFont is executed,
30

30
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:21,600
and to useFonts,
31

31
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,850
you pass an object with instructions
32

32
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,720
about which fonts should be loaded.
33

33
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,660
Now, if you dive into the official
34

34
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:31,710
Expo Fonts documentation
35

35
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:35,410
you'll learn how you could easily include fonts from Google
36

36
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:39,500
because including Google Fonts is made extra simple
37

37
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,240
with help of a special Expo Google Fonts Package.
38

38
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,090
That might be worth a closer look as well.
39

39
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:49,840
Here, I wanna show you how to include any kind of fonts
40

40
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,830
where you might just have your local font files,
41

41
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,490
and therefore in the assets folder,
42

42
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,070
I'll add a fonts sub-folder,
43

43
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:59,940
and attached to this lecture,
44

44
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,530
you'll find two font files
45

45
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:06,770
which you should download and add to this fonts folder.
46

46
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:09,230
The OpenSans-Boldttf file,
47

47
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:12,253
and the OpenSans-Regularttf file.
48

48
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,670
These two files are attached,
49

49
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:15,920
and you should download them,
50

50
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,893
and add them to the fonts folder in the assets folder.
51

51
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,490
Now, once you added them,
52

52
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:24,700
they can be loaded with help of useFonts.
53

53
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,180
For this, in this useFonts object,
54

54
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,550
you must set up property names
55

55
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:33,250
that will later be used for identifying the fonts you loaded
56

56
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,650
and values for these property names,
57

57
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:39,170
that point to these files that should be loaded.
58

58
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:42,427
So for example, this font is called OpenSans
59

59
00:02:42,427 --> 00:02:45,510
so I'll use open-sans as a property name,
60

60
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:48,280
between quotes, since this name includes a dash,
61

61
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,830
and it would be a invalid JavaScript property otherwise.
62

62
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:56,970
And then to load the font and assign it to this identifier,
63

63
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,970
we use this require function,
64

64
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,690
which we already know from images.
65

65
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,260
And here, just as for images,
66

66
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,930
we construct the path to this font
67

67
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,130
that should be loaded.
68

68
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:12,000
In this case, it's OpenSans-Regularttf.
69

69
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,590
And make sure you introduce no typo here
70

70
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,390
because otherwise loading that font will of course fail.
71

71
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,350
Now, we also have to bold version
72

72
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,860
for this I'll load open-sans-bold here,
73

73
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,513
and point at OpenSansttf like that.
74

74
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,970
This will load these fonts.
75

75
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,980
Now, what you should typically do
76

76
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,800
is that whilst these fonts are loaded
77

77
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,060
you wanna show a loading screen,
78

78
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:41,060
or you wanna show the splash screen of the app
79

79
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,140
which is the app loading screen
80

80
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,653
until the fonts have been initialized.
81

81
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:47,383
And to do this,
82

82
00:03:47,383 --> 00:03:51,430
we can install another package with expo install,
83

83
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:55,133
and that would be the expo-app-loading package.
84

84
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:00,460
This gives us a utility component, which we can render
85

85
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:03,020
which will prolong the splash screen,
86

86
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:06,510
and will ensure that the splash screen is still shown
87

87
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,113
until some condition is met.
88

88
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,920
So now with this package installed,
89

89
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,943
we can import app-loading from expo-app loading,
90

90
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,483
and we wanna show this as long as we're loading fonts.
91

91
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:23,183
Now to find out if we are still loading,
92

92
00:04:23,183 --> 00:04:27,130
useFunds, thankfully returns an array,
93

93
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,980
where the first element
94

94
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,730
which we can extract with array destructuring,
95

95
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,753
as we did it for useState,
96

96
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:37,860
where the first element is actually a boolean,
97

97
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,950
that indicates whether the fonts
98

98
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,833
have been loaded yet or not.
99

99
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,610
So we can now use this boolean
100

100
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,730
to render our app loading component,
101

101
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,900
which will then show the splash screen
102

102
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,863
until the fonts have been loaded.
103

103
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,410
So here I'll check if not fonts loaded,
104

104
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:57,080
so if we are still loading,
105

105
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:01,470
and in that case, I will return AppLaoding like this.
106

106
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,640
So in that case, I will show the splash screen,
107

107
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,570
and once the fonts have been loaded
108

108
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:07,780
the component will be re-executed,
109

109
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:11,223
and then we will not show the splash screen anymore.
110

110
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,033
But now with that,
111

111
00:05:13,033 --> 00:05:14,700
we can use our custom fonts
112

112
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:18,120
because that is of course the main reason for loading them.
113

113
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,630
And it's up to you where you wanna use them,
114

114
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:21,830
but I, in the end,
115

115
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:26,210
wanna use my fonts in different places of the app.
116

116
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:29,290
For example, I wanna use my fonts here,
117

117
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:32,490
in the Title and Instruction text,
118

118
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:35,530
and NumberContainer elements.
119

119
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:39,490
And therefore, in Title.js to use my custom font,
120

120
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:42,810
we can, by the way, remove the colors import here
121

121
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,620
since we don't need it anymore.
122

122
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,850
But here to use the custom font
123

123
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,600
all we have to do
124

124
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,500
is go to our style object,
125

125
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,550
and add the fontFamily property,
126

126
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,423
as we would do it in CSS.
127

127
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,470
And now we can use these identifiers,
128

128
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:01,410
that we assigned in the app component.
129

129
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:05,140
So in my case, open-sans or open-sans-bold.
130

130
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:08,390
And here I wanna use open-sans-bold
131

131
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,370
since I wanna have some bold text.
132

132
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,750
We can now remove the fontWeight here
133

133
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,713
because this font which we load, is already bold.
134

134
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,220
Now in the InstructionText
135

135
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,240
I wanna use just open-sans,
136

136
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,763
so there I'll add fontFamily open-sans, like this.
137

137
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,940
And in the NumberContainer,
138

138
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,800
I wanna use the bold font again.
139

139
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,600
So here for number-text,
140

140
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,280
again we can comment out the fontWeight
141

141
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,760
but I'll add a fontFamily of open-sans-bold
142

142
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,173
or whatever you chose as your font identifiers.
143

143
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,570
With that, if we reload the entire apps,
144

144
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:47,050
the font is now a different one,
145

145
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:48,070
as you can tell,
146

146
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:50,390
because we're now using this custom font
147

147
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:53,110
that is getting imported.
148

148
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,540
The difference might not be huge
149

149
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:57,440
but it is a different font which we have here.
150

150
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,870
So that's how you can add custom fonts
151

151
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,233
to a React Native app.
