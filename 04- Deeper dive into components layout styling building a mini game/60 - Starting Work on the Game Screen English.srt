1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:03,410
So let's start working
2

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:05,370
on this game screen now.
3

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,720
And we got a couple of things that should be added there.
4

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,530
For example, the main thing that's happening
5

5
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:14,490
on this screen is that our phone,
6

6
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,929
so the program in the end, the app, is guessing a number
7

7
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:21,680
and then we have controls to tell the program
8

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,140
if the number is too high or too low.
9

9
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,190
Therefore, we definitely need to output the guessed number
10

10
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:32,950
and we need to derive the guessed number as a first step.
11

11
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,080
Then we need to output the controls
12

12
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,240
that allow us to provide feedback to the program
13

13
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,760
and then we need to recalculate a new number
14

14
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,890
based on that feedback.
15

15
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:46,020
In addition, I wanna log all the rounds we had in the game,
16

16
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,600
so I wanna log the different guesses that have been made.
17

17
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,331
Therefore, here in the game screen,
18

18
00:00:51,331 --> 00:00:53,950
we will definitely need a view to group
19

19
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,373
all these different UI elements that we need.
20

20
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:59,520
So we'll have this main view
21

21
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,411
and then in there, I wanna have a text where I say
22

22
00:01:02,411 --> 00:01:07,310
opponent's guess, this is just a title,
23

23
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,660
but I want to have this kind of title here,
24

24
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:13,160
then below that, I want to have the actual guess
25

25
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:17,360
being output and yes, we can't add text like this in a view
26

26
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,100
but this is just a placeholder.
27

27
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,720
We'll add a nice component
28

28
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,360
that shows the guess by the opponent here.
29

29
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,060
And then below that I wanna have another view
30

30
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,250
which holds the controls that we have to tell the opponent,
31

31
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:35,203
the program, whether the guess was too high or too low.
32

32
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,200
So here we could have another text
33

33
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,010
where we say higher or lower
34

34
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:45,190
and then below that we have our two buttons,
35

35
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:47,870
where we basically show a plus or minus
36

36
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:50,500
to indicate whether it's too low or to high.
37

37
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,420
These are all the chess placeholders
38

38
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,513
we'll add real buttons instead soon.
39

39
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,340
And then below all of that,
40

40
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:01,503
we'll have another view where we log our rounds.
41

41
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,720
So that's the general structure
42

42
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,600
with plenty of placeholders that we have here
43

43
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,150
and we'll have to fill those placeholders step by step
44

44
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:15,140
and we'll have to style this overall screen step by step.
45

45
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:18,960
And I'll start by styling this view that wraps everything.
46

46
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,640
I wanna make sure that we don't have the content
47

47
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,620
crammed up to the edges here,
48

48
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,230
instead, it should be centered,
49

49
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:29,460
it should be clearly visible on the screen.
50

50
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,820
And of course for that, we can use good old Flexbox.
51

51
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,150
So we'll add a style sheet here
52

52
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:38,630
in this game screen component, as well
53

53
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,990
and create the styles constant
54

54
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,810
which then will hold a style sheet
55

55
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:49,230
that is created with the create method
56

56
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:52,440
and then here in this style sheet object,
57

57
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,690
I'll add a property named screen.
58

58
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:57,170
Name as always, is up to you though,
59

59
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:00,230
which gets flex one to make sure it takes up
60

60
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,730
all the available space,
61

61
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:03,680
instead of just the space needed
62

62
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,580
by the content of the element that receives this property.
63

63
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,740
We wanna take all the available space instead.
64

64
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:15,380
And I'll already add some padding, let's say, 12 pixels,
65

65
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:19,140
to make sure that we add some distance in all directions,
66

66
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:22,193
so that we have some distance to the device edges.
67

67
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,770
Now for the moment, that's it.
68

68
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:26,660
For a start, that's good enough.
69

69
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:29,880
And then I'll add this style to this view,
70

70
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,543
as we did it many times before, like this.
71

71
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:38,070
If we save this, I get an error, of course,
72

72
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:41,820
because I have these texts here which must go into texts
73

73
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,870
and I'll just comment those placeholders out
74

74
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:47,530
because they are just meant to be used as placeholders,
75

75
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,470
not as actual text.
76

76
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:52,010
I also have this text, of course.
77

77
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:53,720
Let's count this out, as well.
78

78
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,730
Now with that finally, if I go to this screen
79

79
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,530
we have this extra content,
80

80
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:02,750
but it's actually still in the top left corner.
81

81
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,670
Now actually, there is some padding here,
82

82
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:08,980
as you can tell if I ramp up the padding to 40,
83

83
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:13,693
now it's moved in further, but 12 pixels wasn't enough.
84

84
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,410
Now we didn't have the problem here
85

85
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,330
on the start game screen
86

86
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:20,840
because on this screen, we do add
87

87
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,680
quite a lot of margin to the top.
88

88
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,300
We could add this here, as well on this game screen,
89

89
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,830
but actually I want to introduce a new component
90

90
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:35,190
that is very useful when it comes to adding some distance
91

91
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:38,870
to the device edges, especially to the top of the device,
92

92
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:41,220
to the notch as we have it here.
93

93
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,323
And that's the safe area view.
