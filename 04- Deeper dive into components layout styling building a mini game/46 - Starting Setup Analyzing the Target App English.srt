1
00:00:02,291 --> 00:00:03,440
[Maximilian Schwarzmuller] Now to get started.
2

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,490
I created a brand new expo project
3

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:09,130
and you find my project attached.
4

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:12,780
So that you can use the same starting point as I did.
5

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,100
It's a very simple app with only one component.
6

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,040
The app component
7

7
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,520
with some dummy content and some basic styles.
8

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,323
This will be our starting point for this course section.
9

9
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:28,210
Now in this course section,
10

10
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:29,770
we're going to build this game
11

11
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:32,010
which I already showed you.
12

12
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:35,290
This game of course has multiple screens.
13

13
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:38,500
It has this starting screen, where we
14

14
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:43,440
as the owner of the phone, pick a number between one and 99.
15

15
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,400
And on this screen, we want to do a couple of things.
16

16
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,400
We want to ensure that no number smaller
17

17
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,200
than one or bigger than 99 can be picked,
18

18
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,820
for example.
19

19
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:58,950
We also then want to allow the user to reset this input
20

20
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:02,350
and pick a new number, or finally start a game
21

21
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:05,350
at which point we'll navigate to the game screen.
22

22
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:08,453
The second main screen we have in this game.
23

23
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:10,530
On this screen
24

24
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,890
the phone will guess the number
25

25
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,320
and we have to tell the phone after every guess,
26

26
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,900
if it should guess lower or higher
27

27
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,270
to get closer to our number.
28

28
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:24,290
Now on this screen, we for example
29

29
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:27,340
show a little alert, a little a warning.
30

30
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,500
If we give the phone a wrong hint.
31

31
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,020
If our chosen number is smaller and we tell the phone
32

32
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,270
that it's bigger, something like this.
33

33
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:39,230
Now, besides that every guess by the phone is logged
34

34
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:43,540
and we see our log here, and this log also is scrollable.
35

35
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:47,440
In case we exceed the max available height.
36

36
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,560
Last but not least, once the phone guess our number.
37

37
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,470
We get this Game Over screen
38

38
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:55,000
with a short summary and this nice image.
39

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,690
And then from that screen
40

40
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:59,760
we can start a new game if we want to.
41

41
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,450
And therefore, in this starting app here
42

42
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,730
we will have to add all these screens
43

43
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:08,070
but also plenty of other reusable components.
44

44
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:11,250
Like the buttons we have, because we will build those
45

45
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,940
from scratch ourselves and many other things.
46

46
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,510
And therefore, that's what we'll do
47

47
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,860
for the rest of this section.
48

48
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,880
Now, if you're feeling super fancy
49

49
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,480
definitely try building a first prototype of this game
50

50
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,750
on your own with the basic React
51

51
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,740
and React Native knowledge you have up to this point.
52

52
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,870
You will not be able to recreate the exact same look
53

53
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,410
because there are new components
54

54
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:40,130
and new tricks that we will need to build this result.
55

55
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,650
But maybe you can build a basic prototype
56

56
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:44,630
with React and React Native.
57

57
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:47,690
And if you want to definitely try building this
58

58
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,480
on your own first, but of course
59

59
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,240
otherwise it's perfectly fine to just follow along
60

60
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,550
so that we can build this game together step by step.
61

61
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,640
And at the same time
62

62
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,380
we will learn many new important things
63

63
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,263
about React and React Native.
