1
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:03,930
So let's now dig a bit deeper
2

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:05,610
into this text input field
3

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:07,830
and learn how we can configure it.
4

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,120
We already set a max length, but I also, for example,
5

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,100
wanna control which kind of characters can be entered there,
6

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:19,210
or to be precise, I wanna control which keyboard I get
7

7
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:22,453
when I get a keyboard on my mobile device.
8

8
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:24,940
Because at the moment, as I show you,
9

9
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,450
we get the regular keyboard
10

10
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:28,290
with all those regular characters,
11

11
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:30,560
and that's not what I want.
12

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,470
Now, text input allows you to control which keyboard
13

13
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,620
is opened by the device.
14

14
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:41,620
And it can be controlled with the keyboard type prop.
15

15
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:46,880
Now, this keyboard type prop takes a bunch of values.
16

16
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,600
And it's worth a look at the official docs
17

17
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,720
to understand which values are supported on which platform.
18

18
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,340
If you take a look at the keyboard type prop description
19

19
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,370
in the official docs for the text input,
20

20
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:02,920
you'll learn that there are a couple of values
21

21
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,710
that work across platforms.
22

22
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:08,580
And then there are values which are only available
23

23
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,470
on one of the platforms.
24

24
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,040
So for example, URL is supported on iOS devices,
25

25
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,283
but not on Android.
26

26
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:19,330
Now here, I wanna use the number-pad though,
27

27
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:21,810
which works across platforms,
28

28
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,870
because this will open up a keyboard
29

29
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:27,073
that only shows numbers, which is is what I want here.
30

30
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:32,543
So therefore here all set keyboard type two number pad.
31

31
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:37,520
Now, there also are a couple of other properties we can set.
32

32
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,740
And you see that there are a lot of props that are supported
33

33
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,340
and definitely feel free to browse through them
34

34
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,390
to understand which options you have
35

35
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:47,333
when working with text inputs.
36

36
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,540
Here I, for example, also wanna set
37

37
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:53,910
the auto capitalized option to none.
38

38
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:56,710
It's not too important when working with numbers,
39

39
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:59,150
but if this would contain regular text,
40

40
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:02,100
this would ensure that it's not auto capitalized.
41

41
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,250
Again, that's not really important here,
42

42
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,630
but I wanna show that this kind of prop exists.
43

43
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:10,350
We also have a auto correct prop that allows us
44

44
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:13,350
to turn auto correction on or off.
45

45
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,870
Because it could, for example, be super annoying
46

46
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:19,670
if you have a field where users should enter their email,
47

47
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:22,070
and you have auto capitalization
48

48
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:24,600
and auto correction turned on.
49

49
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,260
We all know these input fields where your email address
50

50
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,970
gets corrected and the first character gets capitalized,
51

51
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:33,950
and you have to fix it thereafter.
52

52
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:36,840
You can avoid such bad user experiences
53

53
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,740
with props like this.
54

54
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:42,110
Again, for this input where we only expect numbers,
55

55
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:43,753
this is not really needed.
56

56
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:48,570
Now with that, if we save everything and I go back,
57

57
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:51,340
you see immediately that on Android,
58

58
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:55,270
we now get a different keyboard which only shows us numbers.
59

59
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,293
And it's the same here on iOS.
60

60
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,320
And that is a huge step forward,
61

61
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:04,050
because that is the behavior we want for this input field.
62

62
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,343
And that's of course pretty nice to have.
63

63
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:10,800
Therefore as a next step, let's leave this input field
64

64
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,930
and let's work on these buttons before we then start working
65

65
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:17,220
on the layout of this box by making sure
66

66
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,963
that these elements are laid out of bit nicer.
