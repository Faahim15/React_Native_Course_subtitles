1
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:03,137
[Maximilian SchwarzmÃ¼ller] Great.
2

2
00:00:03,137 --> 00:00:05,000
So, now we added this save area view.
3

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,110
Let's now continue with styling
4

4
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:10,670
and laying out the rest of this game screen.
5

5
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:13,070
And this opponents guest text, for example,
6

6
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:14,960
should be a title.
7

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,683
Not a small little text as we have it here.
8

8
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,923
And to make it a title we can add some extra styling.
9

9
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:27,849
For this, I'll add a title property here.
10

10
00:00:27,849 --> 00:00:29,960
And then we could say that a title
11

11
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,050
should have a font size of 18 maybe,
12

12
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:35,530
maybe it should have a font weight of bold,
13

13
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:38,180
that might make sense for a title
14

14
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,290
and we can give it a certain color.
15

15
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:43,290
The color is up to you
16

16
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,680
but here I want to use a yellowish color
17

17
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,190
and I'll use the yellow color
18

18
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:50,280
I have here in the start game screen.
19

19
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,973
So I will assign that here.
20

20
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:57,130
Now with that assigned, we can go back
21

21
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:00,563
and add our style here, like this.
22

22
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:04,460
If we do this, this is looking better
23

23
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:06,660
but I'd also like to center it.
24

24
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:11,253
So I'm also going to add text align center,
25

25
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,793
and maybe we ramp up the font size even more to 24 pixels.
26

26
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:20,230
And this looks better.
27

27
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,210
Now, what I want to add in addition,
28

28
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:29,210
is I want to add a little border around this title,
29

29
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,610
and I also wanna add some padding therefore
30

30
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:33,280
so that we have some distance
31

31
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,883
between the border and the actual text.
32

32
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:40,270
So I'll add a border width of two here
33

33
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:44,693
and a border color, of that same yellow as I had it before.
34

34
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:48,640
And last but not least I want to add some padding here
35

35
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,083
in all directions of let's say 12.
36

36
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:55,610
And with this I have this kind of title.
37

37
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:57,470
Now, of course you can adjust the title
38

38
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:59,530
to look however you want it to look,
39

39
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:02,240
but I'm quite happy with this result.
40

40
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,100
By the way, the layout is not final.
41

41
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,280
We will make sure that this is all pushed down
42

42
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,800
a little bit more in the future.
43

43
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,259
But now we have this title and it's probably fair to assume
44

44
00:02:12,259 --> 00:02:16,360
that we might be using a title like this quite frequently,
45

45
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,240
in our application, maybe on different screens
46

46
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,650
but typically with the same styling
47

47
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:25,330
or maybe minor styling differences
48

48
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:28,390
and therefore it would make sense to outsource this text
49

49
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:31,120
into a separate reusable component
50

50
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,920
because that is what we typically do in React
51

51
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,120
when we do have elements that are used
52

52
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,443
in different places of our app.
53

53
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,450
So in the components folder I'll add a new file,
54

54
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:46,610
which I'll name, Title.js.
55

55
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:49,690
And in there, I'll add a component function
56

56
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:52,200
which I'll also name, Title.
57

57
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,460
Which I'll of course export as always
58

58
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,740
and the job of this component is to display
59

59
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,793
such a configurable title.
60

60
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,860
So we can grab this text here
61

61
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,460
from the game screen and cut it from there
62

62
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:09,863
and add it here as a returned JSX code.
63

63
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,500
Of course for this to work, we need to import text
64

64
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,500
from React Native here in this Title.js file
65

65
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,000
and the text here, should of course not be set in stone.
66

66
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,280
Instead I'll remove it
67

67
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,960
and I'll use object destructuring here
68

68
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,751
to pull the children property out of my incoming props
69

69
00:03:30,751 --> 00:03:34,630
and use that here, so that the actual content
70

70
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,940
that is displayed by the title,
71

71
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,540
can be set by adding it between the opening
72

72
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,463
and closing text of my custom title component.
73

73
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,270
And now in GameScreen.js we can use
74

74
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,560
this custom title component.
75

75
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,210
Of course, for this you must make sure
76

76
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:51,593
that it's being imported.
77

77
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:56,283
And then here we can output opponents guests like this.
78

78
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,680
Now for this all to work we also must migrate our styling
79

79
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,250
and we can therefore cut the title style
80

80
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:07,833
from the game screen and move it into the title component.
81

81
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:13,140
There of course we must import style sheet
82

82
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:19,013
and create our styles via style sheet create,
83

83
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:22,653
like this, adding the title property.
84

84
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,770
With all of that, if we save everything
85

85
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:29,360
we got the same title as before and nothing changed here
86

86
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,850
but we have this reusable component
87

87
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:35,203
which we could use in different parts of our application.
