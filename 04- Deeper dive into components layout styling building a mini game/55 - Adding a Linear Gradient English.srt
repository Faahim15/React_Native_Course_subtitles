1
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:06,120
So how can we add a gradient in the background here?
2

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,450
Well, for this we'll utilize expo.
3

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,900
If you search for expo linear gradient,
4

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,770
you will find that expo,
5

5
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:18,450
this extra tool we're using to simplify the process
6

6
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,360
of building React Native apps,
7

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,610
this tool, and the team and company behind it
8

8
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:27,460
provides an extra package called expo linear gradient
9

9
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,640
that gives us a component, which we can use
10

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,333
in our code to display a linear gradient.
11

11
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:38,080
So, what we have to do here is open a new tab
12

12
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,650
in our terminal here
13

13
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:42,730
so that we can install this extra package,
14

14
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:45,610
and we should install it with expo install
15

15
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:49,380
not with npm install, you could do this as well
16

16
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,340
but by using expo install,
17

17
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,620
expo, this tool which we're using,
18

18
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,700
will ensure that a fitting version
19

19
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,980
is installed into this project.
20

20
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,030
So it will take a look
21

21
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,210
at the version of expo you are using in this project,
22

22
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,330
and it will automatically install a dependency version
23

23
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,233
that works well with that expo version.
24

24
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,500
Therefore we'll use expo install here
25

25
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:17,053
and install the expo-linear-gradient package like this.
26

26
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:19,320
If you hit enter,
27

27
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,260
this will execute npm install behind the scenes
28

28
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,420
but as mentioned, it picks a fitting version.
29

29
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:28,890
Now, once it's done, you can close this terminal window
30

30
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,520
and keep the npm start process running.
31

31
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,400
And now we can import LinearGradient
32

32
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,093
from expo linear gradient.
33

33
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,340
And as always, the official docs are a great place
34

34
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,980
to understand how you can use this component
35

35
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,180
in case you're not sure.
36

36
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,220
So now we imported this LinearGradient component.
37

37
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,380
And with that imported,
38

38
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,263
we can replace this view with LinearGradient.
39

39
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,420
And therefore, of course, we can get rid of that view import
40

40
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,510
because we're not using the view component
41

41
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,263
in this app component anymore.
42

42
00:02:08,727 --> 00:02:11,440
Now LinearGradient takes a style prop,
43

43
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,680
and on that style, we still wanna set flex: 1 because
44

44
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,570
the gradient also should take all the available space
45

45
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:21,470
but we won't set a background color anymore
46

46
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,140
because the idea behind that gradient
47

47
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,183
is that we have a gradient between multiple colors.
48

48
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:29,760
And we set those multiple colors
49

49
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,880
with help of the colors prop that is supported
50

50
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,393
by this LinearGradient component.
51

51
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:38,710
This colors prop takes an array
52

52
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:42,610
which takes all the colors you want to use in your gradient.
53

53
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:44,420
That could be two colors.
54

54
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,500
It could be five colors.
55

55
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,150
Again, take a look at the official documentation
56

56
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,840
to learn more about all these supported properties
57

57
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,973
and how you can configure this gradient.
58

58
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,170
Now, the two colors I want to use here are, in the end,
59

59
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,560
the yellow, which we used for the input,
60

60
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,993
so I will pick this.
61

61
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:08,690
But as a first color, I want to use a different color.
62

62
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:11,500
I want to use this plum color
63

63
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,610
which I used for the background of my input container.
64

64
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:18,380
So I will grab this as a first color here,
65

65
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:21,440
separate these items with a comma,
66

66
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,200
and with that, if you save this,
67

67
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,860
you have this nice gradient here in the background.
68

68
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,580
Of course, with that added,
69

69
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,060
to make sure that there is a higher contrast
70

70
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,320
between the background and this container,
71

71
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,170
this input container,
72

72
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,270
we could go back to this container
73

73
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:44,267
and pick a even darker plum color here, like 3b021f.
74

74
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,560
And with that now this is darker
75

75
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,690
and stands out more from the background.
76

76
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,430
But this is how we can add a gradient.
77

77
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:58,340
And thanks to this extra expo package,
78

78
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,203
it's really not difficult.
