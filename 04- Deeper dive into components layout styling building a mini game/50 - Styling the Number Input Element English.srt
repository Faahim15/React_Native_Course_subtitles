1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:05,380
So we got this input box styled a little bit,
2

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:06,740
which is nice.
3

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,610
Now let's work on the elements in that box again,
4

4
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,800
on the input element and the buttons;
5

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,530
which aren't really buttons, at this point.
6

6
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:17,110
We just have a view with a text inside of it.
7

7
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,440
It's not pressable at all.
8

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,810
Now I will work on the buttons in a second step.
9

9
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,403
I wanna start with the input element.
10

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,290
And for this in the start game screen component,
11

11
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:32,620
I'll add another style object in this style sheet.
12

12
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:35,220
And this style object will be responsible
13

13
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,220
for styling the input.
14

14
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,120
Therefore I'll name it, input
15

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,940
or text input or number input,
16

16
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:46,020
since the goal is users enter a number in there.
17

17
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,990
But as you know, the name is up to you.
18

18
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:51,420
Now this will be assigned to this text input
19

19
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,130
by adding this style property to this text input,
20

20
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:59,340
styles.numberInput, like this.
21

21
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,140
And now the styles I do want to add are the following.
22

22
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:06,280
I wanna give this a height of let's say 50 pixels,
23

23
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,440
to have a fixed height on this input.
24

24
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,430
And I want to give the text in there,
25

25
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:16,070
a font size of let's say 32,
26

26
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:19,100
to have a nice big text in there.
27

27
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:24,100
In addition, I wanna change the color of the bottom border.
28

28
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:27,260
I wanna set this to a nice yellow color
29

29
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,470
which I also prepared in advance
30

30
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:34,320
and that would be the hex code, ddb52f, like this.
31

31
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:37,320
This is a nice yellow color
32

32
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,570
and that's the color I want to use here.
33

33
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,460
And of course it's probably clear anyways
34

34
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:45,600
but definitely feel free to play around with those colors
35

35
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,203
and choose your own colors.
36

36
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,610
Now, the border color is not the only thing we need to set.
37

37
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:55,430
We also should set the border bottom width here,
38

38
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:57,950
to make sure that we can see this bottom border.
39

39
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:00,070
And for this I'll crank up the width a little bit
40

40
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,113
and set it to two pixels.
41

41
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:06,850
Now, I also wanna change the color of the text
42

42
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,260
that is entered in this input field,
43

43
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:12,820
and I'll set it to the same yellow as we have it up here
44

44
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,233
for the border bottom.
45

45
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:19,270
So here I add the same string with the same hex code.
46

46
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:23,270
Now it would also be nice to have some empty space
47

47
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,630
above and below the text input.
48

48
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:28,110
And this can be achieved with margin,
49

49
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,140
but to be precise,
50

50
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,810
with margin vertical,
51

51
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,680
which adds the same amount of space
52

52
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,320
to the top and bottom.
53

53
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,163
And here, I want to add eight pixels of space.
54

54
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,030
Last but not least,
55

55
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,930
I'll set the font weight to bold,
56

56
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:43,570
to make sure that we have some nice, bold text,
57

57
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:44,873
that's being entered here.
58

58
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,600
With that, if we save this,
59

59
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,160
we got this yellow border at the bottom,
60

60
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,530
and if I start typing here, this looks quite nice.
61

61
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:58,360
I just think that it's a little bit too wide.
62

62
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,210
We don't need that wide of a input field,
63

63
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:04,610
because we only enter a two digit number in there,
64

64
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,900
or maybe just a one digit number,
65

65
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,490
but definitely nothing longer than that.
66

66
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,680
At the moment, you can enter anything in there
67

67
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,580
but we will soon and restrict this
68

68
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:17,160
and we won't allow values higher than 99.
69

69
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,080
So, this is way too big,
70

70
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,253
way too wide of a input field.
71

71
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,920
Now, to control the width of this input element,
72

72
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,630
we can use Styling,
73

73
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:30,610
but actually not just Styling.
74

74
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,070
But let's start with the styles,
75

75
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:35,120
and then talk about the other thing that we can do.
76

76
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,640
Here on the number input,
77

77
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,530
I wanna make sure that this is shorter,
78

78
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:40,950
that it's not as wide.
79

79
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:43,610
And we can do this by setting a width here,
80

80
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:46,070
on this input.
81

81
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:48,420
And the width could be 50 pixels as well,
82

82
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,010
though you can of course play around with that value,
83

83
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:55,010
to find a fitting with that looks best for you.
84

84
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:58,190
If I saved this, this is now way shorter.
85

85
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,370
It would be nice if the text would be centered
86

86
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:01,203
in there though.
87

87
00:04:01,203 --> 00:04:03,120
And this is something which can be achieved
88

88
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,760
with a styling property,
89

89
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,800
that you might know from the browser;
90

90
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,833
Because that's the textAlign property.
91

91
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,540
We can set this to center,
92

92
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:17,240
to center the text in its containers.
93

93
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,150
So, in this input element, in this case.
94

94
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:23,260
If we save that, the text is centered.
95

95
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:26,050
Now the overall input element is not centered yet.
96

96
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,950
we will do it as in a later step,
97

97
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:30,410
but it is now shorter.
98

98
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:31,740
However, at the moment,
99

99
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,290
you can still enter super long numbers in there,
100

100
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:37,310
which causes this input element to become scrollable,
101

101
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,840
and I don't want to be able to do that.
102

102
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,990
I want to make sure, that users can only enter numbers
103

103
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:47,030
between one and 99, into this input element.
104

104
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:51,320
And therefore we'll have at most two digits, two characters
105

105
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,140
that will be entered here.
106

106
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:56,720
And this can be achieved by adding a special prop
107

107
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,090
to text input, the maxlength prop.
108

108
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:05,340
Now, this prop takes the max number of characters
109

109
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,380
that can be inserted into this input element.
110

110
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,173
So we could try to set this equal to two.
111

111
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:16,260
If we do that though, we get an error, also here;
112

112
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:19,600
On Android it crashed entirely, also nice.
113

113
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,320
And if we have a look at this error,
114

114
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,710
we see that in the end,
115

115
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:25,250
we have a problem with the type I chose.
116

116
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:29,053
I chose type string, but expected is type number.
117

117
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,540
And that indeed is the problem.
118

118
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,720
We provided a string here by using quotes;
119

119
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,320
Yes, it's a prop value, but it is a string,
120

120
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,260
we're using quotes here.
121

121
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:43,380
What we should pass in instead, is a number,
122

122
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,810
and this can be done by using curly braces instead of quotes
123

123
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:48,510
and then passing the number
124

124
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:51,050
between those curly braces, like this.
125

125
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:54,220
If I save this, now I don't have the error.
126

126
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,300
And now if I try to enter more than two characters,
127

127
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,320
it doesn't work;
128

128
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,010
I'm hammering my keys on the keyboard, but nothing happens.
129

129
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:04,670
I can enter two characters at most,
130

130
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,663
and that's exactly what I want here.
131

131
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,960
Now, I will try to restart this on Android,
132

132
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,970
so that we can also preview it there again.
133

133
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:17,030
Sometimes it can crash like this;
134

134
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:19,220
You can try restarting it then,
135

135
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:22,560
or you restart the entire npm-start process
136

136
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,400
but here restarting worked.
137

137
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,390
And now we have our input element there as well.
138

138
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:30,130
So, that's now a first step,
139

139
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:32,170
but we still have a couple of problems here.
140

140
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:35,810
For example, I can still enter any kind of character here,
141

141
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,660
into this input field.
142

142
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,570
I get the regular keyboard,
143

143
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:42,500
which offers me all these regular characters
144

144
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,390
and getting to the numbers is a bit annoying.
145

145
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,560
That is something we can also change
146

146
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,633
because of course that is not the behavior I want here.
