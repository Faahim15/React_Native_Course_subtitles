1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,680
So how can we make everything a bit smaller?
2

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,290
Let's maybe start with this game screen.
3

3
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:10,163
This game screen is okay
4

4
00:00:10,163 --> 00:00:14,260
but some things are a little bit too big.
5

5
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,445
For example, besides the position of that title, which,
6

6
00:00:17,445 --> 00:00:21,790
in my opinion, is a little bit too far at the top,
7

7
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:26,080
we might wanna decrease the width of this a little bit.
8

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,610
And if we have a look at our game screen, JS file,
9

9
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:32,220
there, we have various styles.
10

10
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,360
But of course, for this title
11

11
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,100
we don't have any specific styles
12

12
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,770
because data is a custom component stored
13

13
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:41,220
in the components UI folder.
14

14
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:45,510
And if we go there, we see that in the end
15

15
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,840
we have no real settings regarding the width
16

16
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,480
that should be taken up by this title.
17

17
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,640
Instead, we basically take all the width we can get
18

18
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,360
and the only spacing around it, this title, therefore
19

19
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,400
is margin or padding applied to this title
20

20
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,460
or to the container holding this title.
21

21
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:04,980
And that might be fine,
22

22
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:09,830
but what we could do here, is we could give this a max width
23

23
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:13,240
of let's say, 80%.
24

24
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,710
And that then should be a string,
25

25
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:16,533
so we should wrap it between quotes.
26

26
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,870
If we do this, then this title gets a bit smaller.
27

27
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:25,470
It's also not centered anymore because the parent container
28

28
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,640
which uses Flexbox, because all views use Flexbox
29

29
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,870
in React Native doesn't center, its child items.
30

30
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:36,420
So we would have to go to the game screen,
31

31
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,420
and then in there go to this view, this screen view
32

32
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:45,410
and make sure that all the children in there are centered
33

33
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:49,593
by adding align items center here like this.
34

34
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:54,360
And now that is all centered again.
35

35
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,940
Now it is up to you whether you like this or not.
36

36
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:00,480
But what I wanna show you and emphasize is
37

37
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,340
that you can use relative units like this,
38

38
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,960
and we have used them before, to control widths and heights
39

39
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,380
and that you can not just set the width and height itself
40

40
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,470
but that you can also set max width or min width
41

41
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:19,443
besides the regular width to create more responsive sizes.
42

42
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:24,340
Because when you set the width, then it's always that width.
43

43
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,320
It's now always 80%.
44

44
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:31,000
With max width, it's up to 80%,
45

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,050
but it could be less if less space is needed.
46

46
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,373
We could, for example, also set a width of,
47

47
00:02:38,676 --> 00:02:41,060
let's say, 300 pixels, which would be the default,
48

48
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,692
but we could then also at max width 80% to make sure
49

49
00:02:44,692 --> 00:02:49,692
that 300 pixels is taken, unless that would be more than 80%
50

50
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,240
of the parent container, in which case the 80%
51

51
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,183
become active.
52

52
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,770
So with this on bigger screens
53

53
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:00,770
we can take a little bit more space, as you can tell by
54

54
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:03,100
the available space to the left and the right of
55

55
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:03,933
the text.
56

56
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:07,400
There is less space available here on the smaller screen.
57

57
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,340
On the bigger screen, this gap is wider.
58

58
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:13,920
But we only take the 300 pixels, which we seem to take here,
59

59
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,130
if there is enough space.
60

60
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:18,830
Here on the smaller screen, 300 pixels
61

61
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:22,236
would be more than 80% of the available width,
62

62
00:03:22,236 --> 00:03:24,570
and therefor the 80% are taken instead since
63

63
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:25,760
that is our max width,
64

64
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,230
and therefor the upper boundary of the width
65

65
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,333
of this container.
66

66
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,610
And what's really important to note is
67

67
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:35,810
that percentage settings like this always refer to
68

68
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:39,140
the parent container that holds an element.
69

69
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:44,003
So, if I say at the title to a max width of 80%, those 80%
70

70
00:03:44,003 --> 00:03:48,040
refer to the parent container that holds the title.
71

71
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:53,040
So, in this case to this view, because of this title,
72

72
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:56,123
this view is the parent container.
73

73
00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:00,891
So, it's the width of this view of which 80% are taken by
74

74
00:04:00,891 --> 00:04:04,900
the title because of this setting.
75

75
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,870
So, percentage units and min and max width combined
76

76
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:12,140
with the regular width can be very helpful.
77

77
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,040
And of course, it's not just about the width.
78

78
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,070
You also have min at max height, in case you have
79

79
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:19,450
similar scenarios where you want to set a
80

80
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,263
minimum or maximum height.
81

81
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:25,960
So, these extra style properties are properties
82

82
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,123
you should be aware of.
