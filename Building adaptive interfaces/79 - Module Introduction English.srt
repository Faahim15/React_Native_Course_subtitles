1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,580
This course section will build
2

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:07,140
up on the previous course section.
3

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,100
Now, in that previous section,
4

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:13,020
we learned a lot about building real React Native apps,
5

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,370
how we can build nice layouts and styles
6

6
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:19,290
and combine multiple components, custom components
7

7
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:23,600
and built-in components to build real mobile apps
8

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,943
with React Native.
9

9
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:28,570
In this course section, we're going to learn
10

10
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,850
how we can make our mobile apps
11

11
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:35,850
and our mobile user interfaces more adaptive and responsive,
12

12
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:40,380
how we can build apps that adapt to different platforms
13

13
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,090
and different device sizes
14

14
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:47,360
and how we can, for example, write platform-specific code
15

15
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,450
which means that we generally have one code based
16

16
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,280
for both iOS and Android, of course,
17

17
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,760
but that in some cases we can differentiate
18

18
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,900
between those platforms and execute slightly different code
19

19
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,770
based on which platform we're running.
20

20
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:06,240
In addition, we're going to learn how we can adjust
21

21
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,250
to different device sizes
22

22
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,920
and for example, update our styling
23

23
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,990
or our layout based on the available width and height.
24

24
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:17,670
And we're going to learn how we can also React
25

25
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,780
to the screen orientation chosen by the user.
26

26
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:24,730
In general, the idea behind this course section is,
27

27
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:27,860
to teach you a broad variety of tools
28

28
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:31,050
that you have to adjust your interface as needed
29

29
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:34,780
and to teach you how you can build adaptive components
30

30
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,510
which live in one and the same code base
31

31
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:41,123
and still can adapt to different environments.
32

32
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,530
Now, for this course section,
33

33
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:46,550
I wanna build up on the app we built
34

34
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,400
in the previous course section
35

35
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,940
and therefore you find the code of that finished app
36

36
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,800
which we built in the previous section attached
37

37
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,650
to this lecture so that we can all start
38

38
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,363
with the same code base.
39

39
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:03,200
Now, here is the app running on iOS and Android.
40

40
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,390
And I would say the look and the layout is quite good.
41

41
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:11,053
There isn't anything obvious that I would want to change.
42

42
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:16,920
But, of course, not all our users are going to use one
43

43
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,910
of the latest iPhones or Android devices,
44

44
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:24,470
instead they might be using older or smaller devices.
45

45
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:28,487
And our app typically should be able to adjust to that.
46

46
00:02:28,487 --> 00:02:31,780
And we wanna adjust our look and feel.
47

47
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:35,660
For example, here I also started an Android emulator
48

48
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,860
based on the Nexus 5 image.
49

49
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:43,610
And I'll close the more recent pixel three device emulator.
50

50
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:46,120
Now this is a fine Android device
51

51
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,630
but as you can clearly tell, it is a bit smaller.
52

52
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:52,700
If I resize this, it just gets bigger here on the screen,
53

53
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:57,130
but if we talk about available pixels, it is smaller.
54

54
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,530
It has less space available.
55

55
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:01,470
And if that would be a real device,
56

56
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,280
the screen would be smaller.
57

57
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,600
We can tell that everything is smaller
58

58
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,363
because everything is bigger here on the UI.
59

59
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,270
And the starting screen still looks all right,
60

60
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:16,900
but if we dive into the game, we notice some differences.
61

61
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,010
For example, the title is right at the top here.
62

62
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:23,230
It's really at the edge of this screen
63

63
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:26,750
because this device is smaller.
64

64
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:31,290
Now, if we play this game here until it's over,
65

65
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:34,410
then we see that also on this game over screen.
66

66
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:36,840
Yeah, it fits on one screen
67

67
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,260
but the title is really already a little bit below
68

68
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,450
the status bar and everything probably
69

69
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:47,673
is a little bit too big for this small of a device.
70

70
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:51,260
So therefore we might wanna adjust some
71

71
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:55,160
of our style settings, some of our layout styles,
72

72
00:03:55,160 --> 00:04:00,160
such that the app looks a bit better on smaller devices.
73

73
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,100
And that's what we're going to start with in this section.
