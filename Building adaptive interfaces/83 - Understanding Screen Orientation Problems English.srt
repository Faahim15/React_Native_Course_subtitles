1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:04,710
So that was the Dimensions API.
2

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,370
Very useful, as you can tell.
3

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,800
Now, there's one thing we can't do with it
4

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,620
and with our app at the moment, though,
5

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:15,930
and that is rotate our screen.
6

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:18,010
I mean, we can rotate it.
7

7
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:19,520
Here I'm using a shortcut
8

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,440
but you can also do this here
9

9
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,940
with the menu on iOS
10

10
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:27,080
and rotate your device.
11

11
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,213
And on Android, you can use these buttons to rotate it.
12

12
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,490
But as you can tell, the screen doesn't adjust to that.
13

13
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:35,763
It doesn't flip.
14

14
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:39,300
The reason for that is that this app here
15

15
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,653
by default has the orientation locked to portrait.
16

16
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:45,410
You can set this in app.json,
17

17
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:48,020
which is a conflict file picked up by Expo
18

18
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:51,680
and this locks the orientation of the app
19

19
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,673
to a certain aspect, in this case to portrait.
20

20
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,270
Now, this is maybe what you want.
21

21
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,350
And to be honest for this kind of app, for this game,
22

22
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,040
it would probably make sense
23

23
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,483
to lock it to that orientation.
24

24
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,260
But of course you could also be building apps
25

25
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,540
where this is not locked in place,
26

26
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,500
and you can also unlock it with Expo
27

27
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,180
by setting this to default, instead of portrait.
28

28
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,650
As a side note, you can also set it to landscape
29

29
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:20,180
to lock it to that mode,
30

30
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,750
but here I'll go to default.
31

31
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,210
Now it's not locked anymore.
32

32
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,230
And if we now flip this, it still doesn't adjust
33

33
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,730
because typically you need to restart your app
34

34
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:32,163
for this to have an effect.
35

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,174
Here I pressed R in the terminal to force a reload
36

36
00:01:36,174 --> 00:01:39,753
and thereafter it's now flipping on iOS.
37

37
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:44,350
On Android, it might still not be adjusting.
38

38
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:47,150
For me it is, but it might not be adjusting.
39

39
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,807
In that case open this menu here
40

40
00:01:49,807 --> 00:01:53,113
and make sure that auto-rotate is on.
41

41
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,786
And once this is on, you should be able
42

42
00:01:56,786 --> 00:02:00,573
to flip this screen on Android as well.
43

43
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,930
Now, what you can see is that
44

44
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,131
if you do change the orientation
45

45
00:02:06,131 --> 00:02:09,200
the app might get broken.
46

46
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,420
Here on Android, we can barely use it still
47

47
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,933
but it doesn't look good.
48

48
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,440
And here on iOS, it looks better
49

49
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,370
but still not perfect.
50

50
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:21,600
There's too much space to the top now.
51

51
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,330
And if we open that keyboard on iOS
52

52
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:26,770
and by default it's not open
53

53
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:28,830
because you can type with the keyboard,
54

54
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:32,800
with your regular keyboard, into the simulator.
55

55
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,800
But if you do force that keyboard by going to IO, Keyboard
56

56
00:02:38,344 --> 00:02:42,626
and then you use that, you toggle that software keyboard
57

57
00:02:42,626 --> 00:02:45,060
then you see that that keyboard actually
58

58
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,230
overlaps the input and you can't actually
59

59
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:50,770
close it by tapping anywhere else.
60

60
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,670
So now the app is not usable anymore here.
61

61
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,980
I can only close it here in the simulator
62

62
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,370
by using this toggle shortcut again.
63

63
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:01,493
But of course the real users of your app won't have that.
64

64
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,497
So therefore this is not working this well
65

65
00:03:05,497 --> 00:03:09,170
in different orientations, as you can tell.
66

66
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:11,470
And that is what we will work on next
67

67
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:14,913
to improve this app for different orientations.
