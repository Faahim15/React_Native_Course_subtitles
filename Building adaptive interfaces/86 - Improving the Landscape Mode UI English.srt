00:00:02,271 --> 00:00:03,400
[Maximilian Shwarzmuller] Now let's continue
2

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,563
with improving this app.
3

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:09,260
If we move on to the next screen here on Android,
4

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,913
we notice a new problem.
5

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,700
In landscape mode, there isn't enough space available.
6

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,910
Even here on iOS it's not really that great.
7

7
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:22,790
It would be usable there but it doesn't look good
8

8
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,980
and on Android on this device here to be precise,
9

9
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,910
it's not really usable in landscape mode.
10

10
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:32,010
Sure we can always switch back
11

11
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:34,950
and that should theoretically work.
12

12
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:39,220
It does work here on iOS and it should be a problem
13

13
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:42,280
with the simulator here on Android because theoretically
14

14
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,810
we should be able to switch here as well
15

15
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:48,210
but either way, the problem is that it should also work well
16

16
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,913
in landscape mode and that is not happening at the moment.
17

17
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:54,790
So how could we improve this?
18

18
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:57,850
There are certainly many ways of improving this
19

19
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,220
but I wanna dive in one specific way.
20

20
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:05,220
I wanna totally change this UI or at least parts of this UI
21

21
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:08,130
when we are in landscape mode
22

22
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:12,837
or when we have more width but less height available.
23

23
00:01:13,763 --> 00:01:16,410
And we can achieve this pretty easily
24

24
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,360
with the Dimensions API
25

25
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,220
but now we're using it for a brand new concept
26

26
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,240
to dynamically adjust the layout structure
27

27
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,943
and the component structure.
28

28
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,370
For this here, in the GameScreen, that is our UI
29

29
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:34,560
as we display it when everything is normal,
30

30
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,023
so in portrait mode.
31

31
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,800
Now what I want to do, is I wanna change this.
32

32
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,360
I wanna render a different UI in landscape mode.
33

33
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,230
For that we can use the Dimensions API
34

34
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:49,550
and I wanna use it such that we can listen to changes
35

35
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:53,420
in the dimensions inside our component function.
36

36
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,060
So therefore, I wanna use this hook,
37

37
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,770
the useWindowDimensions hook.
38

38
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:00,490
And then as you learned, we can use that
39

39
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:02,860
in our component function in the GameScreen,
40

40
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:05,800
we can call useWindowDimensions
41

41
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:10,620
and then we can get our width and height.
42

42
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:13,410
And you don't need to always get both, you can of course
43

43
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,820
just get the one value you might be interested in.
44

44
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,570
Here I'm just getting both to show you
45

45
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:22,280
that both properties exist on this object returned
46

46
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,610
by useWindowDimensions.
47

47
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,940
Now I just wanna find out
48

48
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:28,410
if we have plenty of width available
49

49
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:32,480
in which case I wanna display a layout that is optimized
50

50
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,873
for more width.
51

51
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:39,500
So therefore, maybe down here, right before we return JSX,
52

52
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,773
I in the end want to create a variable,
53

53
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:46,290
content could be the name
54

54
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:51,220
and that content should be the JSX code
55

55
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,490
that should be rendered by default.
56

56
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:56,880
So that could be this NumberContainer with the card below it
57

57
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,793
like this.
58

58
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,900
Therefore, I'll cut this from here
59

59
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,990
and then add this between those fragment tags here
60

60
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:09,923
like that.
61

61
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,920
I used these fragment tags
62

62
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,170
since I have two root components next to each other,
63

63
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:19,760
card and number container are root sibling components
64

64
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,610
and this would not be allowed without such a fragment tag.
65

65
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:26,910
Now that is my default layout
66

66
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:30,340
and therefore I'll inject this content variable here
67

67
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,313
below the title, above the view.
68

68
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,810
With that alone, nothing changes of course,
69

69
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,883
we got the same look and feel as before.
70

70
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,930
But now I do want to change the layout,
71

71
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,770
if we have more width available.
72

72
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:46,180
And for this we could add a if statement here
73

73
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,410
and check if width is maybe greater than
74

74
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:53,893
let's say 500 or 600, you can play around with that.
75

75
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,840
If we have that much width available,
76

76
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,130
then we are likely in landscape mode but even if we're not,
77

77
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:05,040
then I wanna display my UI differently.
78

78
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,310
Then my content, which will be output down there,
79

79
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:12,370
is not this NumberContainer with the card next to it
80

80
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,610
instead I then wanna have my NumberContainer
81

81
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:19,550
but to the left and right of that, I wanna have my buttons
82

82
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,650
and above the NumberContainer,
83

83
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:25,420
I wanna have this higher or lower text.
84

84
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:30,420
So actually here, I will also add the fragment tags
85

85
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,470
but now above the NumberContainer,
86

86
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:37,883
I will have the instruction text here.
87

87
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,460
So copy this down there
88

88
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:44,260
and then left and right of the NumberContainer,
89

89
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,560
I wanna have my buttons,
90

90
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,140
therefore I will wrap this in a view overall.
91

91
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:54,140
And in that view, I then add these two buttons here.
92

92
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:57,570
So I copy the views that wrap the buttons like this
93

93
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,660
but now one button is in front of the NumberContainer,
94

94
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,680
one button comes thereafter.
95

95
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:14,790
If we save that, now the layout changed, as you can tell.
96

96
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,750
It's not looking the way I want
97

97
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,810
because I haven't added all the styles yet
98

98
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:22,660
but you see the card is gone and instead one button is here
99

99
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,347
and the other button comes after the NumberContainer
100

100
00:05:25,347 --> 00:05:28,750
as you can see here on my iOS Simulator.
101

101
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,270
Now of course, the styling is not the styling I want,
102

102
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:35,923
therefore I'll add a new style here
103

103
00:05:35,923 --> 00:05:39,090
to this wide screen content
104

104
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:43,533
and set this to buttonsContainerWide maybe.
105

105
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,220
The name is up to you.
106

106
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,510
Here I'll choose buttonsContainerWide
107

107
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,563
and add this down here.
108

108
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,970
And then here for buttonsContainerWide,
109

109
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:57,980
I want to set flexDirection to row.
110

110
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,940
The default is column so here I'll override it to row
111

111
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,130
and set alignItems to center
112

112
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,683
so that everything is centered vertically.
113

113
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,150
If we save this, I now have this user interface
114

114
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:14,210
which I personally find much better.
115

115
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:16,070
However, you can see here on iOS
116

116
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:21,070
that still the log is pretty cut off and hard to use.
117

117
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,760
So therefore, we might not even want
118

118
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:28,210
that higher or lower text here and simply get rid of that
119

119
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:30,750
because you don't need to have the same elements,
120

120
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,810
you can render two totally different user interfaces
121

121
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,470
or layouts with different content based on the width
122

122
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:38,633
as we're doing it here.
123

123
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:43,770
So now this is gone and now the log is a bit more accessible
124

124
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,033
and easier to see.
125

125
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,390
We might also want to reduce the spacing
126

126
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:53,030
around this container and the spacing above the log
127

127
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,020
and therefore on this listContainer that holds the log,
128

128
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,360
we could, for example, adjust the padding
129

129
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,700
so that there is less padding around the log
130

130
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,743
or at least reduce the padding to top and bottom.
131

131
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:13,780
Alternatively, in the number container, we could of course
132

132
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:16,740
tweak the margin so that there is less space
133

133
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,223
around the NumberContainer that will be reserved.
134

134
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:22,000
Feel free to do that.
135

135
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,860
Here, we now at least got a basic style
136

136
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:27,380
that we can use to play this game.
137

137
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,500
It might still be optimal in portrait mode
138

138
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:34,980
but now it is at least playable in a landscape mode as well.
139

139
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,970
Thanks to adjusting this dynamically.
140

140
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:41,840
And with this, we're left with this game over screen,
141

141
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,420
which doesn't really work in landscape mode
142

142
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,180
as you can tell here.
143

143
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,060
Now definitely feel free to find a way
144

144
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,670
of fixing this on your own.
145

145
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:52,020
In the next lecture, we will fix this together.
