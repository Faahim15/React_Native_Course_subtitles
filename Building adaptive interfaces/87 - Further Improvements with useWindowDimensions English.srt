1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:05,270
So let's now work on this game over screen.
2

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,740
At the moment, it doesn't look that good here.
3

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,540
And I think an easy way of improving the way it looks
4

4
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:15,610
is to shrink the image a bit more and make it scrollable
5

5
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:18,880
so that we can always reach this new game button
6

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,570
even if it would be outside of the screen.
7

7
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,733
And at the moment that is not possible.
8

8
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,670
Now, actually in the game over screen
9

9
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,260
we are already setting the image width and height
10

10
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,240
but at the moment we're only changing it based on the width
11

11
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,680
and we probably also wanna take the height into account.
12

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,040
We also wanna make sure that
13

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,070
if the device orientation changes,
14

14
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,670
we adjust the image size.
15

15
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:45,040
Now to do this
16

16
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,040
we can use this other form of the dimensions API.
17

17
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,793
We can use the useWindowDimensions hook instead.
18

18
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,560
So now instead of setting
19

19
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,770
the width, height, and border radius down there
20

20
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,490
we now wanna do this dynamically
21

21
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:01,720
in the component function
22

22
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,440
to react to changes in these values.
23

23
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,820
We do, of course, also wanna get rid of that code.
24

24
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,610
And here I'm just commenting it out
25

25
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,193
so that we can still see it.
26

26
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,320
So now inside of the game over screen,
27

27
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,210
we can of course use this hook to get
28

28
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,590
the width and the height of this screen,
29

29
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,373
of this size like this.
30

30
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,473
And now we can use this width and height
31

31
00:01:28,473 --> 00:01:30,580
to adjust the image size.
32

32
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:34,880
For this we can set a imageSize of 300 as a default
33

33
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,820
and then we can add a if statement
34

34
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,720
to calculate various alternatives.
35

35
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,720
For example, if the width is smaller than 380,
36

36
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,250
which was the check we had before,
37

37
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:53,250
then we might want to use a image size of 150
38

38
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:56,460
and I'll use the image size
39

39
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,170
for both the width and height later,
40

40
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,483
and also for calculating the radius.
41

41
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:05,310
But we also know that if the height is maybe
42

42
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:10,310
smaller than 380 or smaller than 400, let's say,
43

43
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:14,230
then we also wanna make this smaller.
44

44
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:18,293
Then we might want to set the image size to just 80.
45

45
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:23,700
And then we got a certain image style here
46

46
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,530
which in the end sets a width
47

47
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,780
which is equal to the image size
48

48
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,200
and a height which is equal to the image size
49

49
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,500
and which sets a border radius
50

50
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:38,563
which is image size divided by two.
51

51
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,560
And now it's this image style that should be merged
52

52
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,030
with the other image styles dynamically
53

53
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,500
on that container though,
54

54
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,420
because it was that container
55

55
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,913
on which we set width, height, and border radius before.
56

56
00:02:53,233 --> 00:02:54,070
Now we don't wanna override it,
57

57
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:56,560
because we're still setting some other styles in there
58

58
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,300
but we wanna merge in our new styles.
59

59
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,060
So therefore, again, we can wrap this
60

60
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,660
into an array
61

61
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:07,470
and then simply add our image style object to that array
62

62
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:10,793
so that these styles will also be taken into account.
63

63
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,940
With this, the image is smaller.
64

64
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,460
But if we rotate, it gets bigger again.
65

65
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,593
So this works the way it should here.
66

66
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,700
Now, in addition, as mentioned,
67

67
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,680
we might want to make this all scrollable,
68

68
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,020
even though it's not needed here,
69

69
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,710
but it could be needed on some devices.
70

70
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:32,600
And therefore we can also include the scroll view here,
71

71
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,640
and import that and add this as a wrapper
72

72
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,500
around this entire screen in the end.
73

73
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,800
So we wrap the root view with this scroll view.
74

74
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,150
And now we just wanna make sure that we set flex: 1
75

75
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:50,320
on this scroll view here again.
76

76
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:54,500
So we add style and set this equal to styles.screen
77

77
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,333
maybe again, which we have yet to add.
78

78
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,890
And then we add a new style object here,
79

79
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:03,840
the screen object, as we did it before,
80

80
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,193
where we set flex: 1 like this.
81

81
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:12,080
With that, this now also is scrollable
82

82
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,550
even though it's not needed here
83

83
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,783
but we could scroll if we would need it.
84

84
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,880
And with that, we also fixed that game over screen.
85

85
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,310
And now we should be able to use all these screens here
86

86
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:28,090
and play this game on different screen sizes
87

87
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:30,540
even though it might still be best on portrait,
88

88
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,573
but it now also works on different screen sizes.
