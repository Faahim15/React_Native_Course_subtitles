1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,450
Now to come to an end in this course section
2

2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:08,700
there is one last component I wanna talk about.
3

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,690
And that's the status bar.
4

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,800
We actually did see this early in the course already
5

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,620
and I wanna reintroduce it here.
6

6
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:20,300
The status bar component is a component exposed by Expo
7

7
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,883
which allows us to control how the status bar looks like.
8

8
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:26,250
And typically you want to include
9

9
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,240
that in your app JS file
10

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,840
though you can include it in specific component files
11

11
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,930
specifically components that take up the entire screen
12

12
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,640
to style the status bar differently
13

13
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,593
inside of different components.
14

14
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:45,430
Now, for this, we need to import from expo-status-bar
15

15
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,820
and this is a package
16

16
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,510
that should already be installed by default.
17

17
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,010
And what we import from there is the StatusBar
18

18
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:56,683
between curly braces like this.
19

19
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:01,860
Now we can use this here in my app component in this case.
20

20
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,940
Next to my root component here
21

21
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,960
which in this case is the linear gradient.
22

22
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,280
There I will render my StatusBar.
23

23
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,420
And now since I have two sibling root components
24

24
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:15,280
I will wrap this with this fragment component here.
25

25
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,280
Otherwise this wouldn't be allowed.
26

26
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,830
And on StatusBar,
27

27
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:23,830
you can now set the style to light, like this
28

28
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,480
and you get a white status bar.
29

29
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,883
Now all on iOS where it was gone before.
30

30
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,900
Alternatively, you could set this to dark
31

31
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,810
to get a dark status bar.
32

32
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:38,000
Now here, I'd say light looks a little bit better.
33

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,740
So I'll go for a style light, but as always
34

34
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,770
you can choose the style you prefer, but it is worth noting
35

35
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:48,200
that this status bar component is a key component
36

36
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,140
that allows you to control whenever a status bar is shown
37

37
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,680
as you saw it was missing before and how it looks like.
38

38
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,620
And therefore, typically you wanna add it
39

39
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,860
because you want a status bar
40

40
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,600
and you want the dead status bar to look good.
41

41
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,590
So here you go.
42

42
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,263
The status bar component has got you covered.
