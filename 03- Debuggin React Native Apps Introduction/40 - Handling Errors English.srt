00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,190
[Maximilian Schwarzmuller] Now, let's start this section
2

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:06,440
by exploring error messages.
3

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,100
And at the moment this app has no error,
4

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,880
but we can force one.
5

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,380
Tor this I'll go to the GoalInput.js file
6

6
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:19,780
and in there, I will simply force an error
7

7
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:23,720
by actually setting this image source
8

8
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,730
not to the correct source.
9

9
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:27,230
I will comment this out.
10

10
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:31,700
Instead, I will set the source to just a string,
11

11
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,550
some path to image.
12

12
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:37,890
Now this path doesn't exist, but this doesn't matter
13

13
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,993
because that's also not a good way of defining such a path.
14

14
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:47,180
If I save this, we now get an error here,
15

15
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,760
when we have a look at our emulators at the bottom,
16

16
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,420
and we also get one here in the terminal.
17

17
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,600
And the error message we're getting here
18

18
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,160
is that we provided an invalid prop,
19

19
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,260
to be precise that the source prop is the problem,
20

20
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:08,260
to the image, and that it expected one of type number.
21

21
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,790
Now I will be honest.
22

22
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:14,720
This last part is a bit confusing and you will often have
23

23
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,720
confusing elements in error messages, they are not perfect.
24

24
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:21,700
But what is important is that
25

25
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,300
you read the message because often it gives you
26

26
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:28,540
a first hint at what's wrong and what could be the problem.
27

27
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:31,920
Here the hint is relatively clear that it is related
28

28
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,480
to the source prop of the image component.
29

29
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,680
But even if it's a bit more abstract,
30

30
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,500
you might at least get a first idea
31

31
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,920
of where to look for the problem
32

32
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,953
and where you could maybe fix it.
33

33
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,450
Now, in addition, what's also very useful
34

34
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:50,840
when getting error messages, is this stack trace down here.
35

35
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,220
This tells you where the error occurred.
36

36
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:57,490
The first line isn't too useful
37

37
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,590
because here it points at an image component
38

38
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,800
in some weird path,
39

39
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,080
because that in the end is the bundled code
40

40
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,340
to which it's pointing here
41

41
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,520
and that's not helping us too much.
42

42
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,860
But if you have a look at the parts down here,
43

43
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,470
it becomes more useful.
44

44
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:15,340
Here we learn that it's in the GoalInput component,
45

45
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,110
which is created by the App component.
46

46
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,550
This can be useful if you have the same component
47

47
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,530
being used in multiple components,
48

48
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,040
then you know which instance being used
49

49
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,930
by which other component is causing this.
50

50
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,690
And therefore now it's pretty clear
51

51
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,540
that we should dive into the GoalInput component
52

52
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,120
and that in there we might wanna look for
53

53
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,310
the users of the image component,
54

54
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,803
and then take a closer look at the source prop.
55

55
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,330
And if we're not sure of what should be provided here
56

56
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,460
then of course it's always a good idea
57

57
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,150
to look into the official documentation.
58

58
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,250
If you search for react native image,
59

59
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,910
you should get a direct link
60

60
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:57,060
to the official documentation for this image component.
61

61
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,060
But you can also just go to the React Native main page
62

62
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:05,260
and then to Components, and then find the image there.
63

63
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,950
And here you then learn more
64

64
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,960
about the usage of this component,
65

65
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:13,093
and which kind of value can be passed to the source prop.
66

66
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:16,560
Now, here we forced this error, of course.
67

67
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,830
So it is rather simple to fix,
68

68
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,570
but I wanted to show you
69

69
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:23,530
what you can make of such error messages.
70

70
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,230
And before I save this fixed code
71

71
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:30,190
let's also have a closer look at the emulator again.
72

72
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:33,370
There, we also got a error message at the bottom here.
73

73
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:35,160
And you will sometimes get warnings
74

74
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,680
or error messages down here
75

75
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,000
and you can click on them to see more details.
76

76
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,600
Indeed, you see that here it's actually not an error
77

77
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,410
but a warning, which means,
78

78
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:47,810
yeah, the app still runs but not as intended,
79

79
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,450
in this case no image would be displayed
80

80
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:53,140
and you get a similar output as before.
81

81
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,570
You get basically the same error
82

82
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,880
or warning message up here.
83

83
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,490
And then you got a stack trace down here,
84

84
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,150
though I will say that this output here
85

85
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,850
is not that useful compared to what we had
86

86
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,440
here in the terminal.
87

87
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,960
Here in the terminal it was pretty clear pretty quickly
88

88
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,300
which component, the image component,
89

89
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,500
in which component built by us causes the problem.
90

90
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,490
Here it's not immediately clear.
91

91
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:22,060
Nonetheless, taking a look
92

92
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,910
at this output can also be helpful.
93

93
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,430
At least here we also learned
94

94
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,333
that it is related to an image.
95

95
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:31,730
Now with that I will of course save the fixed code.
96

96
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:35,663
And with that, the apps update and the error goes away.
