1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,230
Now Remote Debugging can be nice
2

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,280
for certain situations.
3

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,660
What I personally find more useful is to use
4

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,670
the React developer tools
5

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,830
and not some specific React native developer tools
6

6
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:18,120
but the regular React devtools.
7

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,980
Now you might know the React devtools as an extension
8

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,870
you can install in your browser
9

9
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:26,720
and that extension will not work for React native.
10

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,070
But what you can do here in a separate terminal
11

11
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:33,500
is you can install them globally on your system,
12

12
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,960
or also as a project only dependency
13

13
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,900
but here I'll install them globally
14

14
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:41,520
with npm install -g react -devtools
15

15
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,600
and here on MacOS, I need to add a sudo
16

16
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,180
in front of this to make it work.
17

17
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,880
You might not need to do that on windows.
18

18
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,960
You definitely don't
19

19
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,310
because sudo doesn't exist there and isn't required there.
20

20
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:57,800
And if you hit enter and you install this package
21

21
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,100
what this will give you is a standalone version
22

22
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,773
of the React devtools.
23

23
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,080
With the devtools installed
24

24
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,940
you can start and by running react -devtools
25

25
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,720
like this as a standalone command in the terminal.
26

26
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,650
And please note
27

27
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,433
that I still have my npm start process up and running.
28

28
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,910
And this opens up a new window.
29

29
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:22,950
This opens up this devtools window here.
30

30
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,590
Now with that up and running, you can go back
31

31
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:30,590
to your simulator, to your app and open that builtin menu,
32

32
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:37,680
that development menu and enable Debug Remote JS again.
33

33
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:40,670
And now the React devtool should connect.
34

34
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:44,530
Now you see that by the way, my color gets lost if I do that
35

35
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:46,070
seems to be a bug.
36

36
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:48,560
I don't know exactly where this is coming from here
37

37
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,760
but the background color set in the app
38

38
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,670
Json file is getting lost
39

39
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,850
as I enable Remote JavaScript Debugging
40

40
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,370
but it is what it is.
41

41
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:02,440
Nonetheless now we got these React devtools up and running
42

42
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,070
and in those tools, that's the nice thing.
43

43
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:08,040
You can see your component tree.
44

44
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,490
You can see the app component
45

45
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:12,720
you see all these devtools components like view and button
46

46
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,200
and then the components that are part of the builtin button
47

47
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,240
which can also be interesting to look into
48

48
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,440
you see your goal input.
49

49
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,610
And what's really nice is if you click on a component
50

50
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:26,390
you see the props it gets and the values of those props
51

51
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:29,080
and you see any state you have in there.
52

52
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,963
And as I, for example, start typing here.
53

53
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,690
You see that this state updates here as well
54

54
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,640
and you can even change this state here
55

55
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,770
to simulate different things and to test different things.
56

56
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:44,770
And you see this updated state gets reflected back
57

57
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:45,993
into the application.
58

58
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,470
And these React devtools are really nice to have
59

59
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,660
because being able to look into your component tree
60

60
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,670
whilst your app is running
61

61
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:58,480
and analyzing your state and your props
62

62
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,030
and even changing those values can be super useful
63

63
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:04,713
especially as you're building more complex apps.
64

64
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,570
Now, of course, if you don't need it
65

65
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:10,120
you might want to not run this
66

66
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,760
and you might want to actually disable
67

67
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,600
this Remote Debugging in that case,
68

68
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,380
since it can cause some performance issues
69

69
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:21,850
but it is a nice to have feature here.
70

70
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:25,203
Now with that, I will reload though and get rid of this.
