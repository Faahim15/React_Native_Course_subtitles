1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:04,620
In the previous course section,
2

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,650
we got started with key React Native
3

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,650
fundamentals and basics.
4

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:12,770
In this course section we are going to explore
5

5
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,680
how we can debug React Native apps
6

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,760
because things go wrong, errors happen,
7

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,920
and you must be able to fix errors on your own
8

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,130
and you must be able to understand your app
9

9
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,370
and dig into your app and the UI you built
10

10
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:31,180
whilst you're building it.
11

11
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,380
Therefore, in this course section
12

12
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:37,320
we are going to take a look at an example error message
13

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,760
and see what we can make of such error messages,
14

14
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,560
which hints we can get out of error messages,
15

15
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,580
and how we should treat and handle error messages.
16

16
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:52,140
Before we then also take a look at some DevTools
17

17
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,070
and some additions we get by using React Native and Expo
18

18
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:00,010
that also help us when it comes to debugging
19

19
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:01,690
React Native apps.
20

20
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:04,020
Now, for this course section,
21

21
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,910
I'm going to use this app we built
22

22
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:07,960
in the previous course section.
23

23
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,860
In case you skipped that section, you'll find it attached
24

24
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,320
so that you can follow along just fine.
25

25
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,823
And with that, let's dive into debugging.
